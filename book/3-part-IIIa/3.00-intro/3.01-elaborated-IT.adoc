=== Special section: The IT senior executive

As you become a manager of managers, your concerns again shift. In Part II, you had to delegate product management (are they building the thing right) and take concern for basic task management and digital operations. Now, as your organization grows, you are primarily a manager of managers, concerned with providing the conditions for your people to excel:

* Setting the organizational mission and goals that provide the framework for making investments in products and projects
* Defining how work is executed, in terms of decision rights, priorities, and conflicts
* Instituting labor, financial, supply chain, and customer management processes and systems
* Providing facilities and equipment to support digital delivery
* Resolving issues and decisions escalated from lower levels in the organization
