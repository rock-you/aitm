===== An IT value scenario

Consider the following scenario:

A woman is wondering if she can afford to dine out that evening.

* She uses her mobile device to access her banking information and determines that in fact she does have enough money to do so.

* She also uses her mobile device to make a reservation and contact some friends to join her.

* Finally, she uses social navigation software to avoid heavy traffic, arriving at the restaurant in time for an enjoyable evening with her friends.

Information technology pervaded this experience. The origins, layers and complex connections of the distributed systems involved are awe-inspiring to consider.

IMPORTANT: *Don't worry about the technological terms for now*

This is an introductory text. You may see terms below that are unfamiliar (Model-View-Controller, IP, packet switching). If you are reading this online, you can follow the links, but it's not required.

As you progress in your career, you will always be encountering new terminology. Part of what you need to learn is when it's important to dig into it, and when you can let it pass for a time.

You should be able to understand the gist presented below that these are complex systems based on a wide variety of technologies, some of them old, some new.

The screen on her cell phone represents information accessed and presented via a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller[Model-View-Controller framework], implemented in the latest version of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript[Javascript], running on an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)[interpreter] that would have taxed a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer[mainframe] thirty years ago. The communication with her bank’s central systems is supported by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)[4G LTE] data which in turn relies on the high-volume https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol[IP backbone] networks operated by the http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/telecom-carrier[telecommunications carriers], based on research into https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching[packet switching] now approaching 50 years old.

The application operating on the cell phone interacts with core banking systems via sophisticated and highly secure https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware[middleware], crossing multiple https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network[network] control points. This middleware talks in turn to the customer demand deposit system that still runs on the mainframe.

The mainframe is now running the latest version of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS[IBM’s zOS] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system[operating system] (a direct descendant of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors#MVT[OS/360], one of the most  significant operating systems in the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing[history of computing]). The "customer demand deposit" banking application running on the mainframe is still based on code written in the lowest level https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language[assembler]. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency. Although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio for such a project has to date not been favorable.

The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing[Cloud] data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language[programming languages] are newer, the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database[database] is structured very differently, and the operating system is https://www.linux.com/[Linux].

Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.

The resulting value is clear:

* In an earlier era, our user might have stayed in, for fear of bouncing a check, or might have gone out and dined beyond her means.
* The phone line at the restaurant might have been busy, so she might have risked showing up with no reservation.
* Before texting and social media, she might not have been able to reach her friends as easily.
* Without the traffic application she might have run into a huge midtown traffic jam and been half an hour late.

Clearly, information technology added value to her life and helped maximize her experiences of social enjoyment.

===== Various forms of IT value

As we have seen, there are many ways in which digital systems deliver value. Some systems serve as the modern equivalent of file cabinets: massive and secure storage for financial transactions, insurance records, medical records, and the like. Other systems enable the transmission of information around the globe, whether as emails, web pages, voice calls, video on demand, or data to be displayed in a smart phone application ("app"). Some of these systems support engaged online communities and social interactions, with conversations, media sharing, and even massive online gaming ecosystems. Yet other systems enable penetrating analysis and insight, by examining the volumes of data contained in the first two kinds of systems for patterns and trends. Sophisticated statistical techniques and cutting edge approaches like neural network-based machine learning increase the insights our digital systems are capable of, at a seemingly exponential rate.

Digital technology generates value in both direct and indirect ways. People have long consumed (and paid for) communication services, such as telephone services. Broadcast entertainment was a different proposition, however. The "consumer" - the person with the radio or television - was not the "customer" - the person paying for the programming to go out over the airwaves. New business models sprung up to support the new media, through the sale of advertising air time. In other words, the value proposition was indirect, or at least took multiple parties to achieve: the listener, the broadcaster, and the advertiser. Finally, some of the best known uses of digital technology were and are very indirect - the above-mentioned banks and insurance agencies using the earliest computers to automate the work of thousands of typists and file clerks. 

===== The startup problem
 most startups can only guess who their customers are and what markets they are in.

some basics on the lean startup approach

we have to have a product dev pipeline to even *start* testing and learning "you’re going to start building your product even before you know whether you have any customers for it."
