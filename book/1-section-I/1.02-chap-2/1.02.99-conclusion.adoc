==== Conclusion

Books and articles are written every week about some aspect of IT infrastructure. We have only scratched the surface in our discussions of compute, network, and storage, and how they have become utility services in the guise of Cloud.

Software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service - each represents a different approach. For the most part, we will focus on Infrastructure as a Service in the remainder of this book, on the assumption that your digital product is unique enough to need the broad freedom this provides.

IT infrastructure is a rich and complex topic, and a person can spend their career specializing in it. For this class, we always want to keep chapter 1 in mind: why do we want it? How does it provide for our needs, contribute to our enjoyment?

There are numerous sources available to you to learn Linux scripting, policy-based configuration management of infrastructure, and source control. Competency with source control is essential to your career and you should devote some serious time to it. You can find many references to source control on the Internet and in books such as _Pro Git_ by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub <<Chacon2009>>. As it is the most important foundational technology for professional IT, whether in a garage or in the largest corporations, you need to have a deep familiarity with it.

===== Discussion questions
. Consider your product idea. Does it have any particular infrastructure needs you can identify, having read this chapter?

===== Research & practice
