=== Current Agile texts

There are hundreds of books on Agile. In this section I will seek to credit specifically collegiate texts that may also be of interest.

* Ashmore, Sondra and Kristin Runyan, http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18349912-introduction-to-agile-methods[_Introduction to Agile Methods_]

* Cobb, Charles G. http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24844947-the-project-manager-s-guide-to-mastering-agile[_The Project MANAGER'S GUIDE TO MASTERING AGILE: Principles and Practices for an Adaptive Approach_]

* Limoncelli, Thomas A., Strata R. Chalup, Christina J. Hogan http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23131211-the-practice-of-cloud-system-administration[_The Practice of Cloud System Administration: Designing and Operating Large Distributed Systems, Volume 2_]
- While not an academic text per se, does have user questions and exercises at end of chapters; I currently use as supplementary text and am scoping this one to complement it
