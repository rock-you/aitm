* stability, state, etc
* complex system failures (Allspaw sidebar?)
* antifragility
* Cynefin
* self-steering, autopoeisis

 is EA using the right tools? systems theory, semantics vs dynamics.

 ====== EA as systems thinking
hard to argue with but evidence is limited

* Postscript: Thought experiment on complete mainstreaming of IT

arch formalisms weak on dynamics - semantics vs dynamics problem semantics gravitate to first order predicate logic, binary thinking continuous math... required... how to measure anything. systems thinking.


 ===== EA and design thinking

 Design thinking is encroaching on architecture. Enterprise design?
_the sheer absurdity of undertaking something so ambitious, on the one hand, and, foolhardy, on the other, as any kind of intentional design of so complex and poorly (and even mis-) understood an entity as an organization in a context of rapid change._ <<Malan2010>>

 "Architecture of software is a collection of design decisions that are expensive to change." <<Ran2001>>

 [quote, Ruth Malan]
 For enduring competitive advantage, the organization needs to seek leverage across its products and/or services and to create strategic capabilities that are hard to imitate because they rely on a mix of process, technology, skills, resources, facilities, culture, and even history <<Malan2005>>
