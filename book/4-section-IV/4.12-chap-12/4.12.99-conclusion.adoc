===== Discussion questions



===== Research & practice

* Compare and contrast business model versus operating model, and in the same analysis consider the distinction between enterprise architecture and business architecture. Can enterprise architecture be equated with the operating model? If business architecture is a subset of enterprise architecture, does that mean it also is primarily concerned with the operating model? Or is business architecture also concerned with the business model?
