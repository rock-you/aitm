In the last section, we discussed what architects *do*. The focus was primarily architects in a "team of teams" environment, not strictly at the level of a single product team. However, while this chapter has a strong Enterprise Architecture orientation, it is about the practice of "architecture" more generally. In this chapter, we will break down the different practices of architecture and their relationships.

We have seen the xref:Zachman[Zachman Framework] previously. The higher levels are considered "business" or "operating model" concerns, while the lower levels are more technical. In discussing the various domains of architecture, however, a simpler structure is useful. The numerous columns in the Zachman framework don't necessarily translate to specific architecture domains (there are many data architects, but not many who specialize in questions of timing -- the "when" column.)

Archimate(r) is a modeling language and standard of The Open Group, which we will discuss more later in the chapter. It uses a framework that can be viewed as a simplification of the Zachman model:

.Similar to <<Open2012>>, section 2.6

The interesting wrinkle, as we look at the overall structure of the architecture disciplines, is that we have three disciplines that correspond to hierarchical "layers":

* Business architecture
* Application architecture
* Technology architecture

And one discipline (Information and Data architecture) that corresponds to an entire column (Passive Structure, or "What" in Zachman terms). For evidence of this, see the Data Management Body of Knowledge, which covers the gamut of information and data topics from high level glossaries all the way down to physical database administration.

There are other kinds of architecture that don't fit neatly into this arrangement. *Software architecture and solutions architecture* are perhaps more on the application level, but solutions architecture especially is a loose term. In general, it is restricted to one product, or a few products working together. Within that scope, it may incorporate concepts from infrastructure to business architecture. Software architecture is usually aligned with application architecture, but not all application architecture is software architecture. For example, information architecture is also a form of application architecture, in the sense of how the user understands the meaning and data represented by a web site or application.

===== Business architecture
[quote, William Ulrich, Business Architecture: The Art and Practice of Transformation]
Business architecture offers views of the business that are unavailable from other sources, including IT. Business architecture can tell you what is being done, by which business units, for certain customers, involving various products, via certain processes, involving selected business information. Business architecture generated blueprints serve as the basis for root cause analysis of critical business requirements while providing the foundation for establishing a solution-oriented roadmap that leaves the speculation and guesswork by the roadside. In a word, business architecture delivers "transparency" to a wide variety of internal teams, roles and business units <<Ulrich2010>>, p. 195.

Business architecture is defined by the Business Architecture Body of Knowledge as "a blueprint of the enterprise that provides common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands."

BIZBOK goes on to say that "the value of business architecture is to provide an abstract representation of an enterprise and the business ecosystem in which it operates. By doing so, business architecture delivers value as an effective communication and analytical framework for translating strategy into actionable initiatives. The framework also enhances the enterprise's capacity to enact transformational change, navigate complexity, reduce risk, make more informed decisions, align diverse stakeholders to a shared vision of the future, and leverage technology more effectively."

BIZBOK covers the Osterwalder Business Model Canvas extensively. (pp XX) In so doing, it clearly implies that the concept of the business model is of interest for business architects.

Let's compare and contrast the business model versus the operating model, and in the same analysis consider the distinction between enterprise architecture and business architecture. Can enterprise architecture be equated with the operating model? If business architecture is a subset of enterprise architecture, does that mean it also is primarily concerned with the operating model? Or is business architecture also concerned with the business model? Perhaps the best definition is that business architecture is the component of enterprise architecture most concerned with the enterprise business model as opposed to the enterprise operating model.

In the final analysis, all this book can do is recommend caution and careful inquiry for readers who find themselves in the midst of such debates, which can become quite contentious.

Leaving aside these abstract debates, there are a number of 

Things we DO NOT expect to see in business architecture
Specific technology products (Oracle 11g)
Specific devices (NASRVDCPRD01234.att.com, serial # TRN26543FJDC)
Software architectures (.Net assembly, REST API, Java object)
Detailed deployment diagrams
Specific project plans
Flowcharts beyond large-grained lifecycles

Process and its relatives
Ordered (at least partially), “glass box,” countable
Value chain
Value stream
Business process
Workflow
Procedure
Task
Step
Processes CROSS Functions. (Michael Hammer)

Function and its relatives
Unordered, “black box,” steady state
Function
Capability
Service (sometimes)
Often implies hierarchy

Data and its relatives
The universe of discourse.
Ontology
Semantics & Semantic Web
Objects (sometimes)
Data subjects & records
Entities/attributes/relationships
Tables/columns/constraints

System and its relatives
A relatively fixed form instantiation of definite methods, often based on general purpose computing machinery. Practically relevant. Obtainable and operable.  (You can buy one of these.)
Application (sometimes)
Service (sometimes)
Technology product

====== Data architecture

We covered data architecture in depth in xref:chap-ent-info-mgmt[Chapter 11], and so we won't do so here.

Some notes..

===== Solutions architecture

====== Software architecture

[quote, Grady Booch]
Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change.

====== "Coding architects?"
Primarily in SW domain
But virtualization now makes it possible for all archs to be hands-on, even w/pkgs

<<Cohn2010>> chapter on architect role - confusion of software & enterprise arch

keep EAs off product teams, agree but they set overall direction @ portfolio level difficult for them to stay hands on


===== Technical architecture

cost of entry lower and lower
cost of support - still a problem

 ===== Enterprise architecture
all of the above
