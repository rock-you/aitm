In the last section, we discussed what architects *do*. The focus was primarily architects in a "team of teams" environment, not strictly at the level of a single product team. However, while this chapter has a strong Enterprise Architecture orientation, it is about the practice of "architecture" more generally. In this chapter, we will break down the different practices of architecture and their relationships.

We have seen the xref:Zachman[Zachman Framework] previously. The higher levels are considered "business" or "operating model" concerns, while the lower levels are more technical. In discussing the various domains of architecture, however, a simpler structure is useful. The numerous columns in the Zachman framework don't necessarily translate to specific architecture domains (there are many data architects, but not many who specialize in questions of timing -- the "when" column.)

Archimate is a modeling language and standard of The Open Group, which we will discuss more later in the chapter. It uses a framework that can be viewed as a simplification of the Zachman model:

===== Business architecture
Business architecture offers views of the business that are unavailable from other sources, including IT. Business architecture can tell you what is being done, by which business units, for certain customers, involving various products, via certain processes, involving selected business information. Business architecture generated blueprints serve as the basis for root cause analysis of critical business requirements while providing the foundation for establishing a solution-oriented roadmap that leaves the speculation and guesswork by the roadside. In a word, business architecture delivers "transparency" to a wide variety of internal teams, roles and business units. Ulrich p 195

The repeatable development of a
structured,
consensus,
representation of
demand-side concepts
essential to the organization’s goals.

Things we DO NOT expect to see in business architecture
Specific technology products (Oracle 11g)
Specific devices (NASRVDCPRD01234.att.com, serial # TRN26543FJDC)
Software architectures (.Net assembly, REST API, Java object)
Detailed deployment diagrams
Specific project plans
Flowcharts beyond large-grained lifecycles

Process and its relatives
Ordered (at least partially), “glass box,” countable
Value chain
Value stream
Business process
Workflow
Procedure
Task
Step
Processes CROSS Functions. (Michael Hammer)

Function and its relatives
Unordered, “black box,” steady state
Function
Capability
Service (sometimes)
Often implies hierarchy

Data and its relatives
The universe of discourse.
Ontology
Semantics & Semantic Web
Objects (sometimes)
Data subjects & records
Entities/attributes/relationships
Tables/columns/constraints

System and its relatives
A relatively fixed form instantiation of definite methods, often based on general purpose computing machinery. Practically relevant. Obtainable and operable.  (You can buy one of these.)
Application (sometimes)
Service (sometimes)
Technology product

====== Data architecture
ch 11 backref

===== Solutions architecture

====== Software architecture

[quote, Grady Booch]
Architecture represents the significant design decisions that shape a system, where significant is measured by cost of change.

====== "Coding architects?"
Primarily in SW domain
But virtualization now makes it possible for all archs to be hands-on, even w/pkgs

<<Cohn2010>> chapter on architect role - confusion of software & enterprise arch

keep EAs off product teams, agree but they set overall direction @ portfolio level difficult for them to stay hands on


===== Technical architecture

cost of entry lower and lower
cost of support - still a problem

 ===== Enterprise architecture
all of the above
