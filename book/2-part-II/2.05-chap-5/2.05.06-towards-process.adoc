==== Towards process management

The kanban board has started to get complicated. We're seeing more and more work that needs to follow a sequence, or checklist, for the sake of consistency.

Process management is when we need to start managing

* multiple,
* repeatable,
* measurable sequences of activity,
* considering their interdependencies,
* perhaps using common methods to define them,
* and even common tooling to support multiple processes.

Sometimes, the process simply becomes too complex for humans to follow. Multi-page process models are rarely consulted, even if the team affected developed them. This is especially true when there are many optional or conditional steps in the process.

Before we get into full blown process management, let's look at two at two simpler responses:

* The Checklist Manifesto
* Case Management

===== The Checklist Manifesto

The Checklist Manifesto is the name of a notable book by author/surgeon Atul Gawande <<Gawande2010>>. The title can be misleading; the book in no way suggests that all work can be reduced to repeatable checklists. Instead, it is another in depth examination of the  relationship between standardization and complexity. Like case management, it addresses the problem of complex activities requiring professional judgement.

Unlike case management (discussed below), it explores more time-limited and often urgent activities such as flight operations, large scale construction, and surgery. These activities, as a whole, cannot be reduced to one master process; there is too much variation and complexity.

However, within the overall bounds of flight operations, or construction, or surgery, there are critical sequences of events that MUST be executed, often in a specific order. Gawande discusses the airline industry as a key exemplar of this. Instead of one "master checklist" there are specific, clear, brief checklists for a wide variety of scenarios, such as a cargo hold door becoming unlatched.

There are similarities and differences between core BPM approaches and checklists. Often, business process management is employed to describe processes that are automated and whose progress is tracked in a database. Checklists, on the other hand, may be more manual, intended for use in a closely collaborative environment (such as a an aircraft cockpit or operating room), and may represent a briefer period of time.

We will revisit Gawande's work in Chapter 9 with the coordination technique of the xref:submittal-schedule[submittal schedule].

===== Case Management

NOTE: Do not confuse "Case" here with Computer Assisted Software Engineering.

Case management is a concept used in medicine, law, and social services. Case management can be thought of as a high-level process supporting the skilled knowledge worker applying their professional expertise.

As the following images suggest, full process management specifies tasks and their flow in precise detail. We have not yet got to that point with our Kanban board, but when we start adding checklists, we are beginning to differentiate the various processes at a detailed level. Cases are another way of thinking about the relationship between the Kanban board and process management.

To quote the Workflow Management Coalition:
****
[Business Process Modeling] and [Case Management] are useful for different kinds of business situations.

* Highly predictable and highly repeatable business situations are best supported with BPM.
** For example signing up for cell phone service: it happens thousands of times a day, and the process is essentially fixed.
* Unpredictable and unrepeatable business situations are best handled with ACM.
** For example investigation of a crime will require following up on various clues, down various paths, which are not predictable before hand. The are various tests and procedures to use, but they will be called only when needed.
<<WFMC2010>>, via <<England2013>>

Noted IT consultant and author Rob England contrasts "case management" with "standard process" in his book  _Plus! The Standard+Case Approach: See Service Response in a New Light_ <<England2013>>. Some processes are repeatable and can be precisely standardized, but it is critical for anyone working in complex environments to understand the limits of standard process. Sometimes, a large "case" concept is sufficient to track the work. The downside may be that there is less visibility into the progress of the case -- the person in charge of it needs to provide a status that can't be represented as a simple report.

==== Process basics
[quote, reinertsen p86]
For a manufacturer, reducing variability
always improves manufacturing economics. This is not true in product
development.

one of the principal purposes of processesâ€”to manage work without
needing a manager and to reduce the cost and increase the value of outcomes of
repetitive tasks. Good processes supplement management, augment its reach, and
ensure consistency of quality outcomes.
Abbott, the art of scalability

===== BPM fundamentals
We've discussed some of the factors leading to the need for process management, but we haven't yet come to grips with what it *is*.

Process management is grounded in business fundamentals. Businesses convert inputs (capital, materials, staff talent) into valuable outputs and generate valuable surplus (margin) for shareholders and other stakeholders.

This act of *conversion* is a *process*. The overall process has been described by Michael Porter as a "value chain."

anchor:value-chain[]

image::images/3_09-valCh.png[]
_Value Chain similar to <<Porter1998>>._

Note the progression along the bottom: first, raw materials are acquired, then manufactured, then distributed at which point they are marketed and sold, and ultimately serviced. Porter termed this set of activities "Primary."

The upper half represents what Porter termed "support." Supporting activities represent necessary, but not value adding, functions.

There are many criticisms of the Porter value chain. Without research and development, there is no product, so why is it considered a support activity (and confusingly named just "Technology Development")? Surely, marketing and sales help drive demand for the product, especially with manufacturing lead times shrinking, so why do they appear so late in the game?

Overall, the model represents a manufacturing-centric world where customers were happy to buy what was on offer.

However, this does not change the fact that most value has some rough ordering to it (it is difficult to sell and service a product before you invent and produce it), and the idea that some activities are primary while others are supporting also is useful.

The value chain as a whole is high level. We can think of a large company in these terms, but we cannot easily manage it this way. Value chains therefore are the ultimate "process" but in order for process to have value, we need to take it down a level or two.

In order to do this, we should clarify some terms.

anchor:process-function[]

===== Process and related terms

The following terms often appear in discussions of process:

* Function
* Capability
* Practice

We will use the following definitions:

anchor:process-def[]
A *process* is an ordered, countable set of activities; an event-driven, value-adding sequence that can be measured and improved. The following terms often are used to describe processes or their components:

* Value chain
* Value stream
* Business process
* Workflow
* Procedure
* Task
* Step

Processes *cross* functions.

Visually, processes are often represented with chevrons, like Porter's original value chain:

image::images/3_09-chevrons.png[]

There is no industry standard that definitely lists the concepts above in terms of granularity. Is a "task" larger or smaller than a "procedure?" We will not discuss these much. However, between the high level concept of "value chain" and the concepts of "process" and "activity," is the concept of "*value stream*."  This is a key concept from the Lean community, and is a relatively higher-level concept (a value chain decomposes into value streams, according to some.)

An example of a value stream could be the complete manufacturing and sales process for one product family. Because they are more specific, value streams are more measurable and countable. Optimizing them in terms of eliminating wasted time, effort and inventory is an objective of Lean thinking. See _Learning to See_ by Rother and Shook <<Rother2003>>.

*Functions* are unordered, steady state domains of activity. An organizational chart often can be based on various functions. Functions also often imply hierarchy. They are more difficult to measure or improve; usually, improving a function means improving some process it owns or performs.

Functions, especially when they are closely aligned to an organizational structure, may be represented as a hierarchy:

image::images/3_09-hier.png[]

They may also be represented as nested shapes:

image::images/3_09-hier-nested.png[]

However - and this is an important point - functions do *not* necessarily need to reflect the organizational chart. Often, they are used as a "logical" construct, to help with organizational design.

What do we mean by this?

Suppose two companies merge. They may leave their organizational charts untouched for a time, because they do not know what parts of each company should merge together. They have two sets of developers, two sets of sales staff, and so on. They do not feel that either company's organizational structure is a good basis for the new, larger company.

To solve this, they might create a logical functional hierarchy, with no-one's name on any part. Where their actual organization structure (temporarily) has duplication, the logical hierarchy does not. They then start to populate it with individuals and teams from the previous companies and in this way develop a new organizational structure.

image::images/3_09-hier2.png[]

This kind of thinking can help the organization evolve over time. If different teams find themselves performing similar activities, a functional analysis might indicate a new organizational structure.

Finally, the following two terms are also unordered, but have different connotations from function:

* Capability
* Service (sometimes)

A *capability* is a generic term for a capacity or potential.

A *service* is a transactional act of value, simultaneously produced and delivered (more on this later).

Finally, the concept of *practice* is the least formalized of the concepts. It represents a loose, conceptual area that may represent a community of common interest (for example, a Java community of practice). It's not usually measured or tracked for improvement. Some topics may start as a practice and formalize into a function, for example Capacity management.

Review the section on the xref:spotify-model[Spotify model]. How does it relate to the discussion here?

We say that an IT management capability may be implemented by a process, function, or practice.
