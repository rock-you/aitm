==== Conclusion

Information management is far more than creating databases. At scale, it is a challenging topic invoking fundamental questions of human understanding and meaning. It drives specialization and non-trivial governance issues, and has inherent contrasts with the perspectives of software development.

The exabytes of stored data accumulated by the human race represent an asset of incalculable value. Organizations that invest in and cultivate the ability to understand and effectively use this data to create information and actionable knowledge may prosper and serve their stakeholders well.

===== Discussion questions
* Identify a situation where you can put a price tag on having or not having information.

* As a group, each of you list at least 5 organizations who you know to store significant data about you. Compare and discuss.

* Have you ever had your data poorly handled, e.g. either corrupted or exposed? Do you have any privacy concerns? Compare experiences and discuss.

* Have conflicting definitions of some word ever caused you problems or led to interesting experiences? Discuss.


===== Research & practice
* Develop a simple conceptual data model of some aspect of your experience: hobbies, interests, extracurricular activities, etc. How would you build a small database for a social club, for example?

* Implement your concept as a simple database, e.g. in Microsoft Access or equivalent.

* Work through https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf[An Introduction to R].

* Build a minimum viable demonstration of some https://d3js.org/[D3.js] visualization.

* Research "slowly changing dimensions" and summarize the alternatives for solving the problem.
