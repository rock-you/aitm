==== Product discovery

[quote, Jacques Murphy, Pragmatic Marketing]
 What is a Product Manager? A Product Manager is the one person in the whole organization who owns the product Requirements effort. Requirements focuses on the WHAT, which means it isn't Development, which focuses on the HOW. And Marketing traditionally talks about the WHAT, but cannot necessarily decide what the WHAT should be. At least not at any useful level of detail. <<Murphy2007>>

Now that we have discussed the overall concept of product management and why it is important, and how product teams are formed, we can turn more specifically to the topic of product discovery and design.

We have previously discussed the overall xref:digital-context[digital business context], as a startup founder might think of the problem. But the process of discovery continues as the product idea is refined, new business problems are identified, and solutions (such as specific feature ideas) are designed and tested for outcomes.

NOTE: In this book, we favor the idea that products are "discovered" as much or more than they are "designed." But you will see both terms used throughout this chapter. See the parable xref:flower-and-cog[the Flower and the Cog] for an illustration of the difference.

The presence of a section entitled "product discovery" in this book is a  departure from other IT management textbooks. "Traditional" models of IT delivery focus on projects and deliverables, concepts we touched on in the  xref:2.04.01-process-project-product[last chapter section] but that we will not explore in depth until later in the book.

However, the idea of "product discovery" *within* the large company is receiving more and more attention. Even large companies xref:fowler-quote[benefit] when products are developed with tight-knit teams using fast feedback.

NOTE: The term "intrapreneurship," credited to Gifford Pinchot, means "entrepreneurship inside a large company."

For our discussion here, the challenge with the ideas of projects and deliverables is that they represent approaches that are more xref:2.00.1-open-loop[open loop], or at least delayed in xref:2.00.01-feedback[feedback]. Design processes do not perform well when feedback is delayed. xref:system-intent[System intent], captured as a user story or requirement, is only an hypothesis until tested via implementation and user confirmation.

===== Formalizing product discovery

[quote, Ronnie Kohavi, Online Experimentation at Microsoft]
It is humbling to see how bad experts are at estimating the value of features (us included).


In Chapter 3, we needed to consider the means for describing  xref:system-intent[system intent]. Even as a bare-bones startup, some formalization of this starts to emerge, at the very least in the form of test-driven development:

image::images/2.04-simplePipeline.png[]

But, the assumption in our emergence model is that more formalized product management emerges with the formation of a team. As a team, we now need to expand "upstream" of the core delivery pipeline, so that we can collaborate and discover more effectively. Notice the grey box in the following:

image::images/2.04-PipelinewProdDisc.png[]

The most important foundation for your newly formalized product discovery capability is that it must be *empirical and hypothesis-driven*. Too often, product strategy is based on the HIPPO: The Highest Paid Person's Opinion.

The problem with relying on "gut feel" or personal opinions is that people -- regardless of experience or seniority -- perform poorly in assessing the likely outcome of their product ideas.

Some well known research on this topic was conducted by Microsoft's Ronny Kohavi. In this research, Kohavi and team determiend that "only about 1/3 of ideas improve the metrics they were designed to improve." <<Kohavi2009>> As background, the same report cites that:

* "Netflix considers 90% of what they try to be wrong"
* "75 percent of important business decisions and business improvement ideas either have no impact on performance or actually hurt performance" according to Qualpro (a consultancy specializing in controlled experiments)

It is therefore critical to establish a strong practice of data-driven experimentation when forming a product team, and avoid any cultural acceptance of "gut feel" or deferring to HIPPOs. This can be a difficult transition for the company founder, who has until now served as the de facto product manager.

===== Product discovery techniques

There are a wide variety of techniques and even "schools" of product discovery and design; we will consider a few representatives in this chapter section.

Of course, when you first started your journey in Chapter 1, you might also have used some of these techniques. But now that you are a team, you are formalizing and relying on these techniques.

These techniques are not mutually exclusive; they may be complementary.
But at the more detailed, digital product level, how do we develop hypotheses for testing, in terms of our products/services? We briefly mentioned User Story Mapping in our discussion of xref:system-intent[system intent.] But that is only one of many techniques. Other tools include:

* "Jobs to be done" analysis
* Impact mapping
* Business analysis & architecture

anchor:jobs-to-be-done[]

====== Job to Be Done
[quote, Theodore Levitt]
Customers don't want a quarter-inch drill. They want a quarter-inch hole.

[quote, Henry Ford, (apocryphal)]
If I'd asked the customer what they wanted, they would have said "faster horses."

The "Jobs to be Done" framework was created by noted Harvard professor Clayton Christensen, in part as a reaction against conventional xref:product-mgmt-v-marketing[marketing] techniques that

_"frame customers by attributes—using age ranges, race, marital status, and other categories that ultimately create products and entire categories too focused on what companies want to sell, rather than on what customers actually need."_ <<Christensen2015>>

"Some products are better defined by the job they do than the customers they serve," in other words. <<Traynor2016>> This is in contrast to many kinds of business and requirements analysis that focus on identifying different user personas (e.g. 45-55 married Black woman with children in the house). Jobs to be Done advocates argue that "The job, not the customer, is the fundamental unit of analysis" and that customer "hire" products to do a certain job. <<Christensen2006>>

To apply the Job to Be done approach, Des Traynor suggests filling in the blanks in the following <<Traynor2016>> :

*Why do people hire your product?*

People hire your product to do the job of --------  every ---------- when ----------. The other applicants for this job are --------, --------, and --------, but your product will always get the job because of --------.

Understanding the alternatives people have is key. It's possible that the job can be fulfilled in multiple different ways. For example, people may want certain software run. This job can be undertaken through owning a computer (e.g. having a data center). It can also be managed by hiring someone else's computer (e.g. using a Cloud provider). If one is not attentive and creative in thinking about the diverse ways jobs can be done, one is at risk for disruption.

anchor:impact-mapping[]

====== Impact mapping

Understanding the relationship of a given feature or component to business objectives is critical. Too often, technologists (e.g software professionals) are accused of wanting "technology for technology's sake."

Showing the "line of sight" from technology to a business objective is therefore critical. Ideally, this starts by identifying the business objective. Gojko Adzic's _Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects_ <<Adzic2012>> describes a technique for doing so:

_An impact map is a visualisation of scope and underlying assumptions, created collaboratively by senior technical and business people._

Starting with some general goal or hypothesis (e.g. generated through Lean Startup thinking), one builds a "map" of how the goal can be achieved, or hypothesis can be measured. A simple graphical approach can be used:

image::images/2.04-impactMap.png[]

NOTE: Impact mapping is similar to mind mapping, and some drawing tools such as Microsoft Visio come with "Mind Mapping" templates.

The most important part of the impact map is to answer the question "Why are we doing this?" The impact map is intended to help keep the team focused on the most important objectives, and avoid less valuable activities and investments.

For example, in the above diagram, we see that a bank may have an overall business goal of customer retention. (It is much more expensive to gain a new customer, than to retain an existing one, and retention is a metric carefully measured and tracked at the highest levels of the business.)

Through focus groups and surveys, the bank may determine that staying current with online services is important to retaining customers. Some of these services are accessed by home PCs, but increasingly customers want access via mobile devices.

These business drivers lead to the decision to invest in online banking applications for both the Apple and Android mobile platforms. This decision in turn will lead to further discovery, analysis, and design of the mobile applications.

anchor:biz-analysis-ch1[]

====== The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge

One well-established method for product discovery is that of business analysis, formalized in the _Business Analysis Body of Knowledge_ (BABOK), from the International Institute of Business Analysis <<IIBA2015>>

The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) defines business analysis as (p. 442):

_The practice of enabling change in the context of an enterprise
by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to
stakeholders_.

BABOK is centrally concerned with the concept of requirements, and classifies them thus:

* Business requirements
* Stakeholder requirements
* Solution requirements
** functional requirements
** non-functional requirements
* Transition requirements

BABOK also provides a framework for understanding and managing the work of business analysts; in general it assumes that a BA capability will be established and that maturing such a capability is a desirable thing. This may run counter to the Scrum ideal of cross-functional, multi-skilled teams. Also as noted xref:system-intent[above], the term "requirements" has fallen out of favor with some Agile thought leaders.

anchor:discovery-v-design[]

===== Discovery and design

Some of the most contentious discussions related to IT management and Agile come at the intersection of software and systems engineering, especially when large investments are at stake. We call this the "discovery versus design" problem.

Frequent criticisms of Lean Startup and its related digital practices are:

 * They are relevant only for non-critical Internet-based products (e.g. Facebook and Netflix)
 * Some IT products must fit much tighter specifications and do not have the freedom to "pivot" (e.g. control software written for aerospace & defense systems)

anchor:flower-and-cog[]

*Parable: The flower and the cog*

*THUNK!*

_Hello. Where did you come from?_

*I fell. From that machine.*

_Machine?_

*Yes, that big loud thing that just passed by. And is now stopped over there.*

_Why is it stopped?_

*Because I am no longer with it. The machine needs me to function. I am called a "cog." Where did you come from?*

_I am a flower. I grew from a seed._

*You ... grew?*

_Yes._

*You mean, no-one planned or designed you?*

_Not that I know of. What does it mean to be "designed" or "planned"?_

*I am part of a greater whole. The need for me was understood when that greater whole was conceived. I was designed to fit a very particular place. +
  +
They had to try making me out of different metals, and different ways to make me. This took some time and effort -- longer than was planned, in fact. But it was always understood that there would need to be a cog in a certain place in the machine.*

_Interesting. So you will never be more than you are?_

*No. I will always be a cog. They might make a different machine, with different cogs, but they will not be me. Are you part of a machine?*

_No. I grew here because it suited me. I have continued to grow for a couple years. Eventually I may grow 20 feet tall, if the conditions remain good. I can adapt to other plants, and find my way around them to the sunlight and the water I need. Or I may stay smaller, if I can't get the sunlight I need. Or I may die._

*Aren't you part of a system that defines your purpose?*

_I don't know. Sometimes I think I am a system myself, made up of my roots, stem, leaves, and flower. There are insects living on me who rely on me for food and shelter.  And I have the freedom to grow into one of the largest trees in this area.  That is worth it to me._

*Interesting. Well, it is good you are growing where you are, and not twenty feet further in that direction.*

_Why?_

*Because when they find me, or replace me and fix the machine, it will continue to clear all the land over there.*

_Oh._

VOICES: "Hey Joe, here's that gear the tractor must have thrown."

"Good, grab it and I'll see if I can't get it back in place at least temporarily until we can figure out why it happened."

*Bye.*

_Goodbye. Nice talking to you. Good luck._

*Thanks. You too.*

****

The above parable is meant to illustrate two very different product development worlds. Some product development is constrained by the overall system it takes place within. Other product development has more freedom to grow in different directions -- to "discover" the customer.

The cog represents the world of classic systems engineering -- a larger objective frames the effort, and the component occupies a certain defined place within it. And yet, it may still be challenging to design and build the component, which can be understood as a product in and of itself. Fast feedback is still required for the design and development process, even when the product is only a small component with a very specific set of requirements.

The flower represents the market-facing digital product that may "pivot," grow and adapt according to conditions. It also is constrained, by available space and energy, but within certain boundaries has greater adaptability.

Neither is better than the other, but they do require different approaches. In general, we are coming from a world that saw digital systems strictly as cogs, and moving towards a world in which digital systems are more flexible, dynamic, and adaptable.

And, when digital components have very well understood requirements, usually we purchase them from specialist providers (increasingly "as a service"). This results in increasing attention to the "flowers" of digital product design, as acquiring the "cogs" is relatively straightforward (more on this in the chapter 8 section on sourcing.).

===== Design

[quote, Herbert Simon]
Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones <<Simon1988>>.

[quote, unknown]
The art of making useful things beautiful and beautiful things useful.

Once we have discovered at least a direction for the product's value proposition, and have started to understand the functions it must perform, we begin the activity of design.

Design, like most other topics in this survey text, is a broad and complex area with varying definitions and schools of thought. The Herbert Simon quote at the beginning of this section is frequently cited.

Design is an ongoing theme throughout the humanities, encountered in architecture (the non-IT variety), art, graphics, fashion, and commerce. It can be narrowly focused, such as the question of what color scheme to use on an app or web page. Or it can be much more expansive, as suggested by the field of design thinking. We'll start from the expansive vision and drill down into a few interesting topics.

====== Design thinking
[quote, Thomas Lockwood, Design Thinking]
Design thinking is essentially a human-centered innovation process that emphasizes observation, collaboration, fast learning, visualization of ideas, rapid concept prototyping, and concurrent business analysis, which ultimately influences innovation and business strategy.

Design thinking is a recent trend with various definitions, but in general combines a design sensibility with problem solving at significant scale. It usually is understood to include a significant component of systems thinking. As Tom Fisher, author of _Designing Our Way to a Better World_, notes:

_We've been doing a lot of work in this area of “design thinking,” which takes the thought process and the methods that have been developed for millennia around the design of physical things — products, buildings, cities — and applies that to the so-called invisible world of design, which is all of the systems and organizations that are designed, but we don’t think of them as being designed. And we’re seeing a lot of these systems not working very well._<<Peck2016>>

Design thinking is the logical evolution of disciplines such as user interface design, when such designs encounter constraints and issues beyond their usual span of concern. Although it has been influential on Lean UX and related works, it is not an explicitly digital discipline.

There are many design failures in digital product delivery. What is often overlooked is that the entire customer experience of the product is a form of design.

Consider for example Apple Computer. Their products are admired worldwide and cited as examples of "good design." Often, however, this is only understood in terms of the physical product, for example an iPhone or a MacBook Air. But there is more to the experience. Suppose you have technical difficulties with your iPhone, or you just want to get more value out of it. Apple created its popular Genius Bar support service, where you can get support and instruction in using the technology:

image:images/2.04-geniusBar.jpg[]
_Apple Genius Bar_ footnote:[_Image credit https://www.flickr.com/photos/dong/2691594470/, downloaded 2016-09-19, commercial use permitted_]

Notice that the product you are using is no longer just the phone, or computer. *It is the combination of the device PLUS your support experience*. This is essential to understanding the modern practices of design thinking and Lean UX. As Jeff Sussna, author of _Designing Delivery_, notes, "In order to provide high-quality, digitally infused service, the entire delivery organization must function as an integrated whole." <<Sussna2015>>, p. 18.

====== Hypothesis testing
The concept of hypothesis testing is key to product discovery and design. The power of scalable Cloud architectures and fast Continuous Delivery pipelines has made it possible to test product hypotheses against real-world customers at scale and in real time. Companies like Netflix and Facebook have pioneered techniques like "canary deployments" and "A/B testing."

In these approaches, two different feature approaches are tried out simultaneously and the business results are measured. For example, are customers more likely to click on a green button or a yellow one? Testing such questions in the era of packaged software would have required lab-based usability engineering approaches, which risked being invalid because of their small sample size. Testing against larger numbers is possible, now that software is increasingly delivered as a service.

====== Usability and interaction
At a lower level than the holistic concerns of design thinking, we have practices such as usability engineering. This takes many forms. There are any number of systematic and well-researched approaches to usability & interaction design, visualization, color theory, the pros and cons of various GUI elements, and related topics.

All such approaches, however, should be used in the overall Lean Startup/Lean UX framework of hypothesis generation and testing.

anchor:feature-v-component[]

====== Features vs. components

anchor:2.04.02-features-v-components[]
As your product evolves, you may see an increasing differentiation of concerns, between features and components.

Features are *what* your product *does*. They are what the customers perceive as valuable. “Scope as viewed by the customer” as <<Kennaley2010>> says (p. 169).

Components are *how* your product is *built*, such as database vs. Web components. In other words, they are a form of infrastructure (but infrastructure you may need to build yourself, rather than just spin up in the Cloud).

Feature teams are dedicated to a clearly defined functional scope, while component teams are defined by their technology platform. Component teams may become shared services, which need to be carefully understood and managed (more on this in Section 3).

It may be easy to say that features are more important than components, but this can easily be carried too far. Do you want each feature team choosing its own database? Not recommended. Allowing feature teams to define their own technical direction can result in brittle, fragmented architectures, technical debt, and rework.

Software product management needs to be a careful balance between these two perspectives. Some http://blog.octo.com/en/feature-team-beyond-the-buzzword/[recommend] a ratio of:

* 70-80% Feature teams to

* 20-30% Component teams

We will be revisiting this more systematically in Section III.
