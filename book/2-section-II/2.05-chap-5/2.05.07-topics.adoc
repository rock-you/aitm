 ===== Intersection of product and work management: story branches

 Because the intent leads to the artifact, and the artifact leads to the commit, it makes sense to associate the requirement with a branch in the version control system. This is not required, but makes it easier to trace the requirement to the actual work by which it was fulfilled. This will be discussed further in Section II and its associated labs. This is a continuously evolving problem area, with practices changing rapidly.

Need to allocate between chapters 5, 8, 9 - or touch on & elaborate later?


 Relationship between features and tasks

 Decision rules
 Reinertsen Boeing case

 Rule engines

 Cadence

 Cadence is an important form of synchronization. [more]

 Velocity

Stories are meant to be independent and valuable. Tasks arenâ€™t. By earning velocity at the level of tasks, it is possible to be 70% dev-complete for a release without a single story being dev-complete. <<Narayan2015>>



 A look ahead to project and process

Projects: fixed time/duration/scope, not repeatable.

Processes: repeatable...

 deferrable commitments

 [Dan Pink, Drive: Task, time, technique, and team]

 High priority: incorporate Common Ground paper http://jeffreymbradshaw.net/publications/Common_Ground_Single.pdf
