==== Why organization matters

[quote, Matt Blumberg, Scaling Up]
In the early stages, you have to hire generalists who are both willing and able to take on dozens of tasks at once. Your developers will have to speak with potential customers; your accountants will have to give advice on product direction; and the born salesman on your team will need to put the phone down a few hours a day and set up a new employee’s computer. This is the exciting, four-people-and-an-idea stage popularly associated with startups— but it doesn’t last very long. +
 +
For a lot of your employees, growing out of this phase will be a welcome development: programmers don’t want to be in accounting meetings, and salespeople don’t want to sit in a dark, quiet room with the engineers. People have talents and skills they want to develop, and a healthy degree of specialization allows them to do that.

So, you are getting bigger now.

Even as a cohesive, single team you had increasing complexity of support services. You needed legal and accounting advice to get the startup going. When you started hiring people, you needed HR and payroll. You also are buying things and paying bills, and you’ve got sales people and marketing people and you need to support your customers and collect money they have promised to pay. At some point you need an internal person whose daily job is money (they’ll become the CFO someday).

How are you going to organize? More importantly, how are you going to think about organizing? This is a hard question. It’s important to get organization right, and the question never goes away. There is a lot of theory, history, and advice available on to how to organize your company.

This is not a general business school textbook, or even  a textbook on startups and entrepreneurship. However, in the current environment, it is essential for the digital professional, no matter how specialized, to understand the general context they are operating in. In one chapter, we cannot cover much, but there’s an increasing consensus that the choice of organizational form has a fundamental impact on the success of IT-based product delivery.

 Sense of ownership is at risk of fading as the org fragments and the artifacts grow

 The team remains the highest-value logical unit & must be protected - we didn't talk about pigs / chickens previously

In keeping with our xref:0.01-emergence[evolutionary approach], let’s assume you’ve been fairly ad-hoc in your organizational structure up to now, doing your best to avoid specialization. Perhaps you’ve even been working as a collective. Nevertheless, you’ve needed a variety of skills to get this far in your journey: you are certainly not all Java programmers!

 This is all off base ... need to start with product teams... also, R&D vs back office IT...

Perhaps the first question you need to ask is to what extent you wish to centralize your digital organization. This is a significant one. The current trend is towards decentralizing IT, but there are good reasons to maintain IT as a separate organizational entity. Sriram Narayan, in his book _Agile Organization Design_ (<<Narayam2015>>), points out that "IT work is labor-intensive and highly specialized," and therefore sourcing IT talent is a particular organizational capability it may not make sense to distribute. Furthermore, he observes that IT work is performed on medium to long time scales, and  "IT culture" differs from "business culture." (The last may be debatable in the long run, in the digitally transforming world.)

*Centralized versus decentralized IT*

What do we mean by "centralized" versus "decentralized," anyways? There are many models for structuring IT, but at one end of the spectrum is when everyone doing anything significant with configuring computers, developing software, or supporting IT networking reports up through a powerful Chief Information Officer, who may report to the CEO, COO, CFO, or other senior executive.

By contrast, in a "decentralized" model, computing is procured and managed by diverse managers in other functional units. So, the Human Resource VP might have an IT manager, the Marketing director would have one, and so on. The IT managers might know each other but they report to different managers and may have a very limited ability to share resources and learnings.

As noted at the  xref:1.01.02-IT-as-function-2[outset], IT has certain unchanging aspects regardless of whether is a separate or embedded organization. However, the purpose of this chapter is to help you think carefully about this very question.
