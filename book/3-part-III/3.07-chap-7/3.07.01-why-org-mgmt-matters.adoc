==== Why organization matters

[quote, Matt Blumberg, Scaling Up]
In the early stages, you have to hire generalists who are both willing and able to take on dozens of tasks at once. Your developers will have to speak with potential customers; your accountants will have to give advice on product direction; and the born salesman on your team will need to put the phone down a few hours a day and set up a new employee’s computer. This is the exciting, four-people-and-an-idea stage popularly associated with startups— but it doesn’t last very long. +
 +
For a lot of your employees, growing out of this phase will be a welcome development: programmers don’t want to be in accounting meetings, and salespeople don’t want to sit in a dark, quiet room with the engineers. People have talents and skills they want to develop, and a healthy degree of specialization allows them to do that.

So, you are getting bigger now.

Even as a cohesive, single team you had increasing complexity of support services. You needed legal and accounting advice to get the startup going. When you started hiring people, you needed HR and payroll. You also are buying things and paying bills, and you’ve got sales people and marketing people and you need to support your customers and collect money they have promised to pay. At some point you need an internal person whose daily job is money (they’ll become the CFO someday).

How are you going to organize? More importantly, how are you going to think about organizing? This is a hard question. It’s important to get organization right, and the question never goes away. There is a lot of theory, history, and advice available on to how to organize your company.

This is not a general business school textbook, or even  a textbook on startups and entrepreneurship. However, in the current environment, it is essential for the digital professional, no matter how specialized, to understand the general context they are operating in. In one chapter, we cannot cover much, but there’s an increasing consensus that the choice of organizational form has a fundamental impact on the success of IT-based product delivery.

 Sense of ownership is at risk of fading as the org fragments and the artifacts grow

 The team remains the highest-value logical unit & must be protected - we didn't talk about pigs / chickens previously

In keeping with our xref:0.01-emergence[evolutionary approach], let’s assume you’ve been fairly ad-hoc in your organizational structure up to now, doing your best to avoid specialization. Perhaps you’ve even been working as a collective. Nevertheless, you’ve needed a variety of skills to get this far in your journey: you are certainly not all Java programmers!

 This is all off base ... need to start with product teams... also, R&D vs back office IT...

Perhaps the first question you need to ask is to what extent you wish to centralize your digital organization. This is a significant one. The current trend is towards decentralizing IT, but there are good reasons to maintain IT as a separate organizational entity. Sriram Narayan, in his book _Agile Organization Design_ (<<Narayam2015>>), points out that "IT work is labor-intensive and highly specialized," and therefore sourcing IT talent is a particular organizational capability it may not make sense to distribute. Furthermore, he observes that IT work is performed on medium to long time scales, and  "IT culture" differs from "business culture." (The last may be debatable in the long run, in the digitally transforming world.)

*Centralized versus decentralized IT*

What do we mean by "centralized" versus "decentralized," anyways? There are many models for structuring IT, but at one end of the spectrum is when everyone doing anything significant with configuring computers, developing software, or supporting IT networking reports up through a powerful Chief Information Officer, who may report to the CEO, COO, CFO, or other senior executive.

By contrast, in a "decentralized" model, computing is procured and managed by diverse managers in other functional units. So, the Human Resource VP might have an IT manager, the Marketing director would have one, and so on. The IT managers might know each other but they report to different managers and may have a very limited ability to share resources and learnings.

As noted at the  xref:1.01.02-IT-as-function-2[outset], IT has certain unchanging aspects regardless of whether is a separate or embedded organization. However, the purpose of this chapter is to help you think carefully about this very question.

===== Roles and responsibilities
[quote, abbott]
Some of the most important factors that organizational structure can affect are communication, efficiency, standards, quality, and ownership.

There are two basic models for technology organizations: the IT organization model and the product organization model...The difference in mindset, organization, metrics, and approach between the IT and product models is vast.<<Abbott2015>> p 122.

Corporate technology governance tends to significantly slow time to market for critical projects...IT mindsets are great for internal technology development, but disastrous for external product development. p 124

This chapter is titled "Conway's law." So who was Conway and why is his law so important as we move to a team of teams? Melvin Conway is a computer programmer who worked on early compilers and programming languages. In 1967 he proposed the thesis that:

_Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure_ <<Conway1968>>.

What does this mean? If we establish two teams, each team will build a piece of functionality (a feature or component). They will think in terms of "our stuff" and "their stuff" and the interactions (or _interface_) between the two. Perhaps this seems obvious, but as you scale up it's critical to keep in mind. In particular, as you segment your organization along the xref:AKF-cube[AKF z-axis], you will need to keep in mind the difference between features and components. You are on a path to have dozens or hundreds of such teams. The decisions you make today on how to divide functionality and work will determine your operating model far into the future.

The most important choice at this point is between segmenting along feature lines, versus segmenting along component lines. What do we mean by this?

====== Features vs. components

Features are *what* your product *does*. They are what the customers perceive as valuable. “Scope as viewed by the customer” as <<Kennaley2010>> says (p. 169). They may be "xref:flower-and-cog[flowers]" -- defined by the value they provide externally, and encouraged to evolve with some freedom.

Components are *how* your product is *built*, such as database vs. Web components. In other words, they are a form of infrastructure (but infrastructure you may need to build yourself, rather than just spin up in the Cloud). They are more likely to be "xref:flower-and-cog[cogs]" -  more constrained and engineered to specifications.

.Features versus components
image::images/3_07-feature-v-component.png[feature component matrix,400,,float="right"]

Feature teams are dedicated to a clearly defined functional scope, while component teams are defined by their technology platform. Component teams may become shared services, which need to be carefully understood and managed (more on this to come). It may be easy to say that features are more important than components, but this can easily be carried too far. Do you want each feature team choosing its own database? This might not be the best idea. Allowing feature teams to define their own technical direction can result in brittle, fragmented architectures, technical debt, and rework.

Software product management needs to be a careful balance between these two perspectives. The Scaled Agile Framework suggests that components are relatively

* more technically focused
* more generally re-usable

than features. SAFE also recommends a ratio of roughly 20-25% component teams to 75%-80% feature teams <<SAFE2016>>.
