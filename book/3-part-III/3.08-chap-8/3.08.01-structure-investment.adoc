==== Structuring the investment
[quote, ISO 38500:2008]
Directors should monitor the progress of approved IT proposals to ensure that they are achieving objectives in required timeframes using allocated resources.

Now that we understand the xref:chap-coordination[coordination problem] better, we are prepared to make longer term commitments to a more complicated organizational structure. As we stated in the xref:chap-invest-mgmt[chapter introduction], one way of looking at these longer term commitments is as investments. In fact, we could use the term "portfolio" to describe these various investments; this is not a new concept in IT management.

NOTE: The first comparison of IT investments to a portfolio was in 1974, by Richard Nolan <<Nolan1974>>.

Whatever the xref:digital-context[context for your digital products] (external or internal), they are intended to provide value to your organization and ultimately your end customer. Each of them in a sense is a "bet" on how to realize this value (review the xref:DIBB[Spotify DIBB model]), and represents in some sense a form of xref:prod-discovery[product discovery].

As you strengthen a hypothesis in a given product or feature structure, you increasingly xref:formalization[formalize] it: a clear product vision supported by dedicated resources.



We'll discuss the IT portfolio concept further in Chapter 12.

===== Features versus components
If you choose to organize around products, the discussion revolves around segmenting along feature lines, versus segmenting along component lines. What do we mean by this?

Features are *what* your product *does*. They are what the customers perceive as valuable. “Scope as viewed by the customer” as <<Kennaley2010>> says (p. 169). They may be "xref:flower-and-cog[flowers]" -- defined by the value they provide externally, and encouraged to evolve with some freedom. You may be investing in new features using xref:lean-startup[Lean Startup], the xref:DIBB[Spotify DIBB model] or some other hypothesis-driven approach.

Components are *how* your product is *built*, such as database vs. Web components. In other words, they are a form of infrastructure (but infrastructure you may need to build yourself, rather than just spin up in the Cloud). They are more likely to be "xref:flower-and-cog[cogs]" -  more constrained and engineered to specifications.

Feature teams are dedicated to a clearly defined functional scope, while component teams are defined by their technology platform. Component teams may become shared services, which need to be carefully understood and managed (more on this to come). A component's failure may affect multiple feature teams, which makes them more risky. However, it may be easy to say that features are more important than components, but this can easily be carried too far. Do you want each feature team choosing its own database? This might not be the best idea. Allowing feature teams to define their own technical direction can result in brittle, fragmented architectures, technical debt, and rework.

Software product management needs to be a careful balance between these two perspectives. The Scaled Agile Framework suggests that components are relatively

* more technically focused
* more generally re-usable

than features. SAFE also recommends a ratio of roughly 20-25% component teams to 75%-80% feature teams <<SAFE2016>>.
