Your decision to break your organization into multiple teams is an investment decision. You are going to devote some of your resources to one team, and some to another team, and there will be additional spending still managed at a corporate level. If the results meet your expectations, you will then likely proceed with further investments managed by the same or similar organization structure. How do you decide on and manage these separate streams of investment? What is your approach for structuring them? How do you ensure that they are returning your desired results?

People are competitive. Your multiple teams will start to contend for investment. This is unavoidable. They will want their activities adequately supported, and their understanding of "adequate" may be different from yours--and each other's. They will  be watching that the other teams don't get "more than their share" and are using their share effectively. You start to see that the teams need to be constantly reminded of the big picture, in order to keep their discussions and occasional disagreements constructive.

You now have a dedicated, full-time CFO and you are increasingly subject to standard accounting and budgeting rules. But annual budgeting seems to be opposed to how you have chosen to run your company to date. What alternatives are there? You begin to see that your approach to financial management affects every aspect of your company, including your product team effectiveness.

You begin also to see your vendor relationships (e.g. your Cloud providers) as a form of investment. As your use of their products deepens, it becomes more difficult to switch from them, and so you spend more time evaluating before committing. You establish a more formalized approach. Open source changes the software vendor relationship to some degree, but it's still a portfolio of commitments and relationships requiring management.

Project management is often seen as necessary for financial planning, especially regarding the efforts most critical to the business. The reason it is seen as essential is because of the desire to coordinate, manage, and plan. Having a vision isn't worth much without some ability to forecast how long it will take and what it will cost, and to monitor progress against the forecast in an ongoing way. Project management is often defined as *the execution of a given scope of work within constraints of time and budget*. But questions arise. We are already executing work, without this concept of "project." We have discussed xref:scrum[Scrum] in Chapter 4, xref:kanban[Kanban] in Chapter 5, and various organizational levels and delivery models in xref:scaling-org[the introduction to Part III]. Here we will examine this idea of "scope" in more detail. How would we know it in advance, so that the "constraints of time and budget" are reasonable?

As we have seen in our discussions of  xref:product-mgmt[Product Management], in implementing *truly new products,* (including digital products) estimating time and budget is challenging because *the necessary information is not available*. In fact, creating information -- which (per xref:lean-product-dev[Lean Product Development]) requires tight feedback loops -- is the actual work of the "project." Therefore, in the new Agile world, there is some uncertainty as to the role of and even need for traditional project management. This chapter will examine some of the reasons for project management's persistence and how it is adapting to the new product-centric reality.

In the project management literature and tradition, much focus is given to the *execution* aspect of project management -- its ability to manage complex, interdependent work across resource limitations. We discussed project management and execution in xref:project-mgmt-coordination[Chapter 7]. In Chapter 8, we are interested in the *structural role* of project management as a way of managing investments. Project management may be institutionalized through establishing an organizational function known as the Project Management Office (PMO), which may use a concept of project portfolio as a means of constraining and managing the organization's multiple priorities. What is the relationship of the traditional PMO to the new, product-centric, digital world?
