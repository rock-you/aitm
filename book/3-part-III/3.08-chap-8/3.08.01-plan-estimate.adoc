==== Planning and estimating

===== Planning techniques
Techniques of co-location, synchronization, and liaison all support to varying degrees a concept of planning. Fundamentally, we plan so that the work progresses effectively and efficiently. We seek to optimize the following contradictory goals:

* Delivering results quickly
* Minimizing the waste of un-utilized resources

To meet these goals, we

* estimate so that we have some understanding of our resource needs
* plan so that we understand dependencies (e.g. when one team *must* complete a task before another team can start theirs)

* biz plan & revenue, road map/release plan
inputs: backlog (esp. epics) & akf scaling
