===== Scaling to more than one product

In the xref:chap-coordination[last chapter], we talked of one product with multiple feature and/or component teams. Another kind of state transition is from one product to multiple products.

Consider our hypothetical startup company. At first, everyone on the team is supporting one product and dedicated to its success. There is little sense of contention with "others" in the organization. This changes with the addition of a second product team with different incentives. Concerns for fair allocation and a sense of internal competition naturally arise out of this diversification. Fairness is deeply wired into human (and animal) brains, and the creation of a new product (and associated team) provokes new dynamics in the growing company.

Because resources are always limited, it is critical that the demands of each product be managed using objective criteria, requiring formalization.  This was a different problem when you were a tight-knit startup; you were constrained, but everyone knew they were "in it together." Now you need some ground rules to support your increasingly diverse activities. This leads to new concerns:

* Managing scope and preventing unintended creep or drift from the product's original charter
* Managing contention for enterprise resources
* Execution to timeframes (e.g. the critical trade show)
* Coordinating dependencies (e.g. achieving larger, cross-product goals)
* Maintaining good relationships when a team's success depends on another team's commitment.
* Accountability for results

===== Planning techniques

Fundamentally, we plan so that the work progresses effectively and efficiently. We seek to optimize the following contradictory goals:

* Delivering results quickly
* Minimizing the waste of un-utilized resources (people, time, equipment, software)

To meet these goals, we

* estimate so that we have some understanding of our resource needs, and so that costs can be compared to expected benefits
* plan so that we understand dependencies (e.g. when one team *must* complete a task before another team can start theirs)

* biz plan & revenue, road map/release plan
