==== Conclusion

This chapter is titled "Investments and projects," and represents the middle ground between the foundation of the organizational structure, and the day to day execution of work. Project management will likely remain a significant practice for digital professionals, although there are organizations who achieve significant results without it (i.e., using continuous flow approaches across fixed teams.)

Investments in vendor relationships and the overall approach to tracking the financials of digital work also affect both the organization and its ongoing work execution. While Agile and related practices provide new insights and directions, there are fundamental and unchanging challenges to managing these areas.
