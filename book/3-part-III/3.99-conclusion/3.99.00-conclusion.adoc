=== Part III conclusion

It's been an interesting ride, scaling up from a team to a team of teams.

We've considered our organizational structure and our culture, and the importance of culture in organizational effectiveness.

We've also considered the fundamentals of project and resource management, with some caution and with an understanding that not all work is performed through classical project management and its iron triangle of cost, quality, and scope.

Finally, process management is a critical practice in business operations, and will continue into the digital era. There are a variety of approaches, concerns and techniques that must be considered and correctly applied.

Part III is essential prep to Part IV - essentially, Part III is about management, where Part IV expands into governance and the longest-lived, largest scale concerns for digital delivery.
