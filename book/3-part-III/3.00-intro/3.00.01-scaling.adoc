=== Special section: Scaling the organization and its work
[quote, Roman Pichler, Agile Product Management with Scrum]
here's a general warning: Avoid large projects. Start small and quickly develop a product with the minimum functionality... If you have to employ a large project, scale slowly and grow the project organically by adding one team at a time. Starting with too many people causes products to be overly complex, making future product updates time-consuming and expensive.

As we begin the second half of this book, Pichler's advice above is important. We have spent chapters 1-6 (the first half of the book) thinking mainly in terms of one product and its dimensions. We are  scaling now because we must; we have increasingly diverse product opportunities, or one product that has become so large it must be  xref:AKF-cube[partitioned] in some manner.

==== A three dimensional model

.Part II: increasing certainty footnote:[Similar to figure from <<Cantor2016>>.]

Part II (Chapters 4-6, which we just finished) can be viewed as a logical progression from the uncertainty of developing a novel product, to the day to day work of building its features, to its predictable operation. The "predictability curve" illustrated in the associated figure increases as the digital product stabilizes and moves to a fully operational state.

This question of predictability, of *the degree to which actuals track estimates* and can be known in advance, will be an ongoing theme throughout Part III. As we scale up, our organization takes on more and more work of all kinds, from highly uncertain to very predictable. Understanding the differences in this "portfolio" of work is essential to managing it correctly. There has always been an element of risk; as a startup, your success was not guaranteed! You now find that you are managing different classes of risk simultaneously, and "one size fits all" approaches do not work.

Furthermore, as an organization scales, there is an increasing span in your time horizon and the scope of work you are considering and executing. From the immediate, "hand-to-mouth" days of your startup, you now must take concern for longer and longer time frames: contracts, regulations, and your company's strategy as it grows all demand this.

Finally, the very terminology you use to describe your work becomes more diverse, reflecting in some ways the broader time horizons you are concerned with. Requests, changes, incidents, work orders, releases, stories, epics, problems, major incidents, refreshes, programs, strategies... there is a continuum of how you think about your organization's work efforts. Mostly, the range of work seems tied to how much planning time you have, but there are exceptions: disasters take a lot of work, but you don't get much advance warning!

Therefore, there are three dimensions we'll consider throughout Part III:

* Size of work
* Time horizon
* Predictability

The accompanying cube shows these dimensions visually. It will be applied to examples in subsequent sections. 

==== Part III chapter structure

In thinking about how organizations develop as they scale, it is helpful to consider various time frames:

* Ongoing execution is the actual day to day work, however conceived. It can include defined process activities, project deliverables, the flow of new product functionality, or ongoing improvement and governance.
* Investment decisions are required to charter new products, even in those companies that may be moving away from a traditional project cycle. Investments are usually understood in terms of budget planning, which traditionally has driven the project funding cycle. They represent some statement of intent for a larger scope of work to be performed and/or sustained, based on the organizational platform, which should be able to support multiple investments.
* Organizational changes may take years, and require considerable effort and thought if they are to succeed. One does not change organizational structures lightly or (hopefully) frequently.
* Culture takes longest and is most difficult to change. Both culture and organization have self-reinforcing feedback loops which add complexity to any deliberate attempts to transform them.

==== The delivery models


In addition, we will revisit our delivery models, the "3 Ps":

* Product management
* Project management
* Process management

and also discuss Program Management.


In Chapter 4 we introduced the "3 Ps": xref:process-project-product[process, product, and project management]. It is important that you review them. Sometimes, the concept of "program" is also used. We will call these delivery models: they are organizing paradigms for getting work done. They may depend on each other, but they each have clear industry identity and bodies of knowledge associated with them:

* Product management has the Product Development and Marketing association and authors like Steve Blank and Marty Cagan.
* Program management has the Axelos Managing Successful Programmes guidance
* Project management has the Project Management Body of Knowledge and the PRINCE2 guidance from Axelos.
* Process management has the BPMN and BPEL standards and authors like Geary Rummler, Roger Burlton and Paul Harmon.

.Product versus program management
****
Program management is a term seen in government efforts and military contracting to describe major efforts of uncertain duration and (sometimes) uncertain outcome. Product management is also uncertain of duration and outcome, and the industry does not clearly distinguish between the two. Some companies use concepts of both product and program management; others use one or the other. Stanley Portny describes:

_Program: This term can describe two different situations. First, a program can be a set of goals that gives rise to specific projects, but, unlike a project, a program can never be completely accomplished. For example, a health-awareness program can never completely achieve its goal (the public will never be totally aware of all health issues as a result of a health-awareness program), but one or more projects may accomplish specific results related to the programâ€™s goal (such as a workshop on minimizing the risk of heart disease). Second, a program sometimes refers to a group of specified projects that achieve a common goal_ <<Portny2013>>.

Where both terms are used, program management may be more about delivery and execution (shading into project management's domain), while product management is more about vision and outcome.
****

We order the delivery models by their _variability_. What does that mean? Products and programs have the highest variability. Their outcome may differ considerably from the initial vision that drove them. Projects, in theory, should be reasonably plannable -- their schedule and cost are managed in terms of "plan versus actual" and differences, in theory, should be well controlled and understandable. Finally, process management strives to minimize variation and in its most rigorous form uses statistical control to do so. If we matrix the delivery models with the time frames we get:

.Time frame matrixed to delivery

It is tempting to see a correlation between the time frames and delivery models:

* Culture and organization at a product and program level
* Investment at a project level
* Execution at a process level

However, this correlation is too simplistic.

* Investments are made in products first, which may or may not need projects and/or processes. Rigorous planned projects or detailed, repeatable processes are not, in fact, how product discovery takes place - a mistake the digital industry has fallen into over and over again.
* Project management also may take place without processes, as it may be based on one-time "deliverables" that are not repeatedly produced.
* To support a process requires portfolio investment and organizational structure, but no project may ever be involved. Whether a product is implied by the existence of a process is an interesting question we will think about.

 what is the relationship of the discovery process to the investment process to org

 data, insight, belief, bet - as a loop
 strengthened hypothesis leads to establishing org
 minimal friction to spin teams up/down (Abbott mentioned i think)
 even when you can easily form teams - this is a big deal
 represents what might become a long term high value investment
 NOT a VM to be torn down and spun up repeatedly

 The chapter structure of Part III can be visualized thus:

Clearly, we must think carefully about the relationships between these dimensions. That, in a nutshell, is the purpose of part III.
