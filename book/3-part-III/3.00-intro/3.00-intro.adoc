== Part III: Team of Teams

 Notes on second half of book... as of 2016, this is where the conflict between Agile/Lean IT and the old ways becomes more pronounced ... the first half of the book represents the new industry consensus, but as we seek to scale it up, everywhere one looks one sees unquestioned acceptance of Taylorist approaches unsuited to Lean product management in a services organization ...

*Scenario*

You are now a "team of teams," at a size where face to face communication is increasingly supplemented by other forms of communication and coordination. You are seeing more and more specialization in your organization, with the tendency of functional specialists to identify more with their field than with the needs of your customers and your business.

Your teams are all good, and get results, but in different ways. You need some level of coordination and not everyone can talk to everyone; people are no longer co-located and there may be different schedules involved.

You now have multiple products. As you moved from your first product to adding more, significant organizational evolution was required. Your products may also be developing complex interdependencies. Tensions between various teams are starting to emerge. There is an increasing desire among your stakeholders and executives for control and predictability. Resources are limited and always in contention. You are considering various frameworks for managing your organization. This is where it gets hard.

New employees are bringing in their experiences, and the more experienced ones seem to assume that the company will use "projects" and "processes" to get work done. There are no shortage of contractors and consultants all advocating various flavors of process and project management, some advocating older approaches and "frameworks" and others proposing newer Agile & Lean perspectives. However, the very concepts of process and project management are occasionally called into question by both your employees and various "thought leaders," and it's all very confusing.

We need to understand where these ideas came from, how they relate to each other, and how they are evolving in a digitally transforming world.

Welcome to the coordination problem.

 etymology of co-ordination?

=== Part III introduction

Scenario:

*Chapter 7: Culture and Organization*
 We're getting big.  How are we formally structured? How are people grouped, and to whom do they report, with what kind of expectations? Why this way and not that? Who are we? What are the unspoken assumptions that underly our daily work?

*Chapter 8: Project and Resource Management*
You want to get bigger stuff done. Some argue that you don't need projects at all any more, that it's all about *products*, not *projects*. But you've seen that your most ambitious ideas require orchestration. And when resources are tight (and when aren't they?) their consumption must be governed somehow. Financial management has always been a concern, but it needs increasing formalization as your activities diversify.

Furthermore, do we have the right people doing the the work? How can we find the best people to grow our initiative? We also remain concerned that work continues to flow well, that we don't take on too much work in process, and that people are not overloaded and multi-tasking.

*Chapter 9: Process Management*
OK, we have a structure.  Work needs to flow across the structure, and the projects and products need certain resources and services delivered predictably. Our increasingly specialized organization needs some specialization of processes, and without some kind of coordination our risks increase along with our complexity.

Process management, like project management, is a discipline unto itself and one of the most powerful tools in your toolbox. You start to realize there is a process by which  process itself is managed - the process of continuous improvement.
