==== Conclusion
Organizational development is always an ongoing process of balancing culture, centralization, and autonomy. Rather than seeking any "best practice," it is better to see a toolbox, or perhaps a set of levers you can position in various ways to get different results. As of 2015, product-centric Agile teams are becoming more and more common. But there are ultimately limitations to this approach, which many companies have experienced.

Culture can be difficult to define. We saw how Toyota's success can be understood as a strategy of ingraining particular cultural understandings through pervasive coaching.

Finally, hiring and managing people is a critical concern for digital organizations as with all organizations. Issues of motivation and accountability are becoming better understood, and practices recently seen as "best" (such as forced ranking) are now being abandoned in favor of more team-oriented approaches.

===== Discussion questions
* What kinds of organizational structures have you worked in?
* What do you prefer?
* Think about organizations you know and discuss them in terms of the Schneider matrix and/or the Westrum typology.
* Have you ever worked with a toxic or unaccountable person? Was their behavior promptly confronted, or was it allowed to persist?

===== Research & practice
* Research the history of the original Lockheed Martin Skunkworks under Kelly Martin.
* As a class, group yourself into the various organizational forms and route simple paper-based work between each other, or undertake simple craft projects such as building a Lego set as a team.
* Research the Agile concept of "team" and in particular how the "team" should interact with external forces.
* Research the current viewpoints on McGregor's Theory X and Theory Y.
* Compare and contrast the Scaled Agile Framework and COBIT.
