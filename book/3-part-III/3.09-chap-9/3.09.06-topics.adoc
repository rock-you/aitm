 ===== Efficiency versus flow

Here is a depiction of one dysfunctional pattern, from an interesting presentation by Ari Tikka <<Tikka2013>>, that can emerge in navigating this tension:

image::images/3_07-flow-v-efficiency.png[]

The above slide is worth a careful examination. The idea is that the more effective you are at product flow, the further to the right you are. The more efficient you are with your resources, the further up you are. It is easy to be completely efficient with resources, and have no flow. It is also possible to be very good at flow, but at the cost of little resource efficiency. Being excellent at both, however, is impossible - there is an outer boundary.

Also, there is an interesting dynamic if you seek too much resource efficiency. Loading staff more and more heavily has counterproductive results, in which flow actually decreases, and the resulting "coordination chaos" also decreases resource efficiency in a vicious reinforcing feedback loop.

Types of COPs

 Feature vs Component at scale

We have previously discussed xref:feature-v-component[feature vs component teams]. As a reminder, features are functional aspects of software (things people find directly valuable) while components are how software is organized (e.g. shared services and platforms such as data management).

As an organization grows, we see both the feature and component sides scale. Feature teams start to diverge into multiple products, while component teams continue to grow in the guise of shared services and platforms. Their concerns continue to differentiate and communication friction may start to emerge between the teams. How an organization handles this is critical.

[quote, Alan Turing, Lecture on the Automated Computing Engine -- 1947]
Roughly speaking those who work in connection with the [Automated Computing Engine] will be divided into its masters and its servants. Its masters will plan out instruction tables for it, thinking up deeper and deeper ways of using it. Its servants will feed it with cards as it calls for them. They will put right any parts that go wrong. They will assemble data that it requires. In fact the servants will take the place of limbs... +
 +
As time goes on the calculator itself will take over the functions both of masters and of servants. The servants will be replaced by mechanical and electrical limbs and sense organs… The masters are liable to get replaced because as soon as any technique becomes at all stereotyped it becomes possible to devise a set of instruction tables which will enable the electronic computer to do it for itself…”
