==== Introduction

You're hiring more specialized people with specialized backgrounds. Many of them enter your organization and immediately ask process questions:

* What's your Change process?
* What's your Problem process?
* What's your Portfolio process?

You've not had these conversations before. What do they mean by these different "processes?"

They seem to have some expectation from their previous employment, and if you say "we don't have one" they tend to be confused. You're becoming concerned that your company may be running some risk, although you also are wary that "process" might mean slowing things down, and you can't afford that.

IMPORTANT: As with other chapters in the later part of this book, we are going to introduce Process Mangement "on its own terms." We will then add additional context and critique in subsequent sections.

What is "process?"

http://www.dictionary.com/browse/process[Dictionary.com] defines it as "a systematic series of actions directed to some end . . . a continuous action, operation, or series of changes taking place in a definite manner."

We've discussed xref:work-management[work management], which is an important precursor of process management. Work management is less formalized; a wide variety of activities are handled through flexible xref:kanban[Kanban]-style boards or "card walls" based on the simplest "process" of:

* To do
* Doing
* Done

However, the simple card wall/Kanban board can easily become much more complex, with the addition of swimlanes and additional columns, including holding areas for blocked work:

 to be redrawn

And when tasks become more routine and specialized, formal process management starts to emerge.

Processes are how we ensure consistency, repeatability, and quality. You get expected treatment at banks, coffee shops, and dentists because they follow processes. IT systems often enable processes â€“ a mortgage origination system is based on IT software that enforces a consistent process. IT management itself follows certain processes, for all the same reasons as above.

Process, in terms of "business process," has been a topic of study and professional development for many years. Pioneering Business Process Management (BPM) authors such as Michael Hammer <<Hammer1993>> and Geary Rummler <<Rummler1995>> have had an immense impact on business operations. Toyota considers a clear process vision, or "target condition," to be the most fundamental objective in improving operations (<<Rother2010>>, chapters 5-6).  Designing processes, improving them, and using them to improve overall performance is an ongoing activity in most, if not all organizations.

However, process can cause problems. Processes imply xref:queuing[queues], and in digital and other product development-based organizations, this means invisible work in process. For every employee you hire who expects you to have processes, another will have bad process experiences at previous employers. Nevertheless, process remains an important tool in your toolkit for organization design.

Process is a broad concept used throughout business operations. *The coverage here is primarily about process as applied to the digital organization.* There is a bit of a recursive paradox here; in part, we are talking about the *process by which business processes are analyzed and automated*. By definition, this overall "process" (you could call it a *meta*-process) cannot be made too prescriptive or predictable.

We also introduce process in terms of our xref:emergence-model[emergence model], and therefore focus on the concerns and dynamics that may cause you to notice the concept, and your need for it.

There is a rich body of industry practice we will draw on in our discussion. Business process management for the purposes of the digital organization is just one more form of business process management.

===== Chapter 9 overview

In this section, we will cover:

* Why process management matters, and is not likely to go away
* The basics of process description and modeling
* Some background and history of continuous improvement and process control
* The major IT-related process frameworks
* Emerging approaches for digital process management.

This remains a textbook primarily aimed at digital product management (from concept to operations), and this chapter is primarily about business process *in that context.* However, one of the problems with process management in IT and digital management is that it has not been well aligned to the broader topic of business process management in general. Therefore, this chapter starts with discussion of BPM fundamentals, and then covers IT process management in that light.

===== Chapter 9 learning objectives

* Identify differences between process and project management
* Describe a business process and how it crosses functions
* Demonstrate familiarity with basic principles of process modeling
* Understand the difference between defined and empirically controlled processes, and why this is important for digital product management
* Identify the problems of process proliferation with respect to execution and demand
* Describe the origins, purpose, and scope of IT industry frameworks
