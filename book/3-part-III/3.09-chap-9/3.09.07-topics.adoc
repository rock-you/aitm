 combining agile and "non-agile" teams - plan-centricity can be a mask for poor demand management & multi-tasking

 (from Cohn) In paper describing Scrum, Takeuchi and Nonaka identified
 "subtle control" as one of its six principles. They list staffing decisions as .1 key  management responsibility.  Selecting the right people for the project team while monitor ing shifts in group dynamics and adding or dropping members when necessary [is a key management responsibility].'"We would add an older and more conservative member to the team should the balance shift too much toward radicalism," said a Honda...

 minimal friction to spin teams up/down (Abbott mentioned i think)
 even when you can easily form teams - this is a big deal
 represents what might become a long term high value investment
 NOT a VM to be torn down and spun up repeatedly - also consistent w/Josh Arnold's thoughts in fund team not project

 Mintzberg coordination approaches - chapter 9

 Process as a Mintzberg liaison mechanism

 1 execution in context - feedback loops between levels - differing cadences (Anderson cadences)

 incorporate _Work Rules_

Dojo approach!

Culture change - lighthouse projects


 incorporate Carol Dweck

 Abbott 4-box p 110, performance/behavior

 Resource management is a terrible name. We will use it anyways.

 ===== Efficiency versus flow

Here is a depiction of one dysfunctional pattern, from an interesting presentation by Ari Tikka <<Tikka2013>>, that can emerge in navigating this tension:

image::images/3_07-flow-v-efficiency.png[]

The above slide is worth a careful examination. The idea is that the more effective you are at product flow, the further to the right you are. The more efficient you are with your resources, the further up you are. It is easy to be completely efficient with resources, and have no flow. It is also possible to be very good at flow, but at the cost of little resource efficiency. Being excellent at both, however, is impossible - there is an outer boundary.

Also, there is an interesting dynamic if you seek too much resource efficiency. Loading staff more and more heavily has counterproductive results, in which flow actually decreases, and the resulting "coordination chaos" also decreases resource efficiency in a vicious reinforcing feedback loop.

[quote, Alan Turing, Lecture on the Automated Computing Engine -- 1947]
Roughly speaking those who work in connection with the [Automated Computing Engine] will be divided into its masters and its servants. Its masters will plan out instruction tables for it, thinking up deeper and deeper ways of using it. Its servants will feed it with cards as it calls for them. They will put right any parts that go wrong. They will assemble data that it requires. In fact the servants will take the place of limbs... +
 +
As time goes on the calculator itself will take over the functions both of masters and of servants. The servants will be replaced by mechanical and electrical limbs and sense organs… The masters are liable to get replaced because as soon as any technique becomes at all stereotyped it becomes possible to devise a set of instruction tables which will enable the electronic computer to do it for itself…”
