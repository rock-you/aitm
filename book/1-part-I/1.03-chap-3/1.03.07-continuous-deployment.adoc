==== Releasing software


===== Continuous deployment

Once software is compiled and built, the executable files that can be installed and run operationally should be checked into a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager[Package Manager]. At that point, one can take the last mile step and deploy the now tested and built software to pre-production or production environments. The software can undergo user testing, load testing, integration testing, and so forth. Once those tests are passed, it can be deployed to production.

(What is “production,” anyway? We’ll talk about environments in Section 2. For now, you just need to know that when an IT-based product is “in production,” that means it is live and available to its intended base of end users or customers.)

Moving new code into production has always been a risky procedure. Changing a running system always entails some uncertainty. However, the practice of infrastructure as code coupled with increased virtualization has reduced the risk. Often, a rolling release strategy is employed so that code is deployed to small sets of servers while other servers continue to service the load. This requires careful design to allow the new and old code to co-exist at least for a brief time.

This is important so that the versions of software used in production are well controlled and consistent. The package manager can then be associated with some kind of deploy tool that keeps track of what versions are associated with which infrastructure.

Timing varies by organization. Some strive for true "continuous deployment," in which the new code flows seamlessly from developer commit through build, test, package and deploy. Others put gates in between the developer and check-in to mainline, or source to build, or package to deploy, so that some human governance remains in the toolchain. We will go into more detail on these topics in chapter 6.

===== The concept of "release"
Release management, and the concept of a "release," are among the most important and widely-seen concepts in all forms of digital management. Regardless of whether you are a cutting-edge Agile startup with 2 people, or one of the largest banks with a portfolio of thousands of applications, you will likely be using releases for coordination and communication.

What is a "release?" I have defined it this way in other work: "A significant evolution in an IT service, often based on new systems development, coordinated
with affected services and stakeholders." Release management's role is to "Coordinate the assembly of IT functionality into a coherent whole and deliver this package Into a state in which the customer is getting the
intended value."  (<<Betz2011a>>, pp. 68, 119).

Even as a startup of 1, you know when your product is "ready for prime time" or not. Your first "release" should be a cause for some celebration: you now are offering digital value to some part of the world.

We will talk much more of release management in Parts II and III. At this point, you may not see it as much different from simply deploying, but even at the smallest scale you start to notice that *some changes require more thought and communication than others.* Simple bugfixes, or self-explanatory changes to the product's interfaces, can flow through your pipeline. But if you are going to radically change the system -- even if you only have one customer -- you need to communicate with them about this. And so, the concept of release management becomes part of your world.
