<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Agile IT Management is a perfect fit for my Management Information Systems class to introduce students to the fast-paced world of IT Infrastructure that they will be dealing with shortly upon graduation.  This book uses multiple perspectives (Founder, Team Leader, VP, C-level executive) to demonstrate to the student not only how a business grows, but how they need to continually grow their skill set.  The use of hands-on exercises encouraged by the format of this book complements my teaching style that allows students to learn by doing, failing and doing again.  An additional benefit is that this book begins with a focus on the startup mentality which I will use in my Business Innovation class.</em></p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2013, I was approached by Dr. Bhabani Misra, the head of the Graduate Programs in Software at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. Dr. Misra asked me to teach an "IT Infrastructure" course (SEIS660), focusing on the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, or ITIL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first semester of the class was well received enough for me to be invited back. However, there were complaints from the students that it was too "theoretical." I was attempting to teach using an enterprise architecture style, with lots of abstractions, that just was not engaging students effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also had a team project approach that immediately started the students out as the IT leadership team of a large corporation. This generated feedback that the students wanted something more practical; they were not going to be immediately hired as senior executives!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took this feedback seriously. I especially gave thought to a practical aspect, and so started to develop a lab component. This was and is popular with the students. I also started to think about different approaches for structuring the class that would make more sense for a survey class with a wide spectrum of experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For three semesters I assigned my first book (<em>Architecture and Patterns for IT: Service Management, Resource Planning, and Governance</em>) as a required text for the class. However, I did not write this as a textbook and its limitations became clearer and clearer. It has a strongly architectural approach, approaching the IT management problem as a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">views on a model</a>. I do not recommend this as a pedagogical approach for a survey class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I approached my publisher with the idea of a 3rd edition that would pivot the existing material towards being something more useful in class. They agreed to this and I started the rewrite.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, by the time I was halfway done with the first draft, I had a completely new book. Material from the previous work simply did not fit the emergence model used to structure the narrative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A number of factors converged at this point:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>My view that the "medium is the message" and this extends to choice of authoring approach, intellectual property, DRM, and publisher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contacts with local and international faculty and thought leaders, and a desire to openly collaborate with them on making the book as good as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A desire to freely share at least a rough version of the book, both for marketing purposes and in the interests of giving back to the global IT community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A desire to be able to rapidly update the book with as little friction as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A practical realization that the book might get more uptake globally if available at least in some form as free and open source IP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact I had already started to <a href="https://github.com/StThomas-SEIS660">publish my labs on Github</a>, and had in fact had developed a workable continuous delivery ("DevOps") toolchain (the <a href="https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/Calavera">Calavera project</a>, which has attracted collaborators from the US, Spain, and Israel).</p>

<h3 id="_for_the_student">For the student</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a "survey" text intended for the advanced undergraduate or graduate student interested in the general field of applied IT management. It is grounded in basic computing fundamentals, but does not require any particular technical skills to understand. You do not need to have taken any courses in networking, security, or particular programming languages to read this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, you will be presented with material on such topics, including fragments of programming languages and pseudocode, and need to be willing to invest the time and effort to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book makes frequent reference to digital startups - early stage companies bringing new  products to market that are primarily delivered as some form of computer-based service. Whether or not you intend to pursue such endeavors, the startup journey is a powerful one for your learning. Large information technology organizations in enterprises sometimes gain a reputation for losing sight of business value. IT seems to be acquired and operated for its own sake. Statements like "we need to align IT with the business!" are too often heard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A digital startup exposes with great clarity the linkage between "IT" and "the business." The success or failure of the company itself depends on the adept and responsive creation and deployment of the software-based systems. Market revenues arrive, or do not, based on digital product strategy and the priorities chosen. Features the market doesn&#8217;t need? You won&#8217;t have the money to stay in business. Great features, but your product is unstable and unreliable? Your customers will go to the competition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lessons that digital entrepreneurs have learned through this trial by fire shed great light on IT&#8217;s value to the business. Thinking about a startup allows us to consider the most fundamental principles as a sort of microcosm, a small laboratory model of the same problems that the largest enterprises face.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this is not a textbook (or course) on entrepreneurship. It remains IT-centric. <strong>And, the book is also intended to be relevant to students entering directly into large, established enterprises.</strong> In fact, it prepares the student for working in all stages of growth because it progresses through these four contexts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individual (founder)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small company (team of teams)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether in a startup, or on a journey within a larger, established organization, you will (hopefully) become aware as you progress through a broadening context:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other team members</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suppliers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sponsors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Necessary non-IT capabilities (finance, legal, HR, sales, marketing, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Channel partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Senior executives and funders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Auditors and regulators</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Part of maturing in one&#8217;s career is understanding how all these relationships figure into your own overall system of value delivery. This will be a lifelong journey for the student; the author&#8217;s intent is to provide some useful tools.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="_assumptions_of_the_reader">Assumptions of the reader</h3>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>This book is written at the advanced undergraduate/graduate student level. It is currently available only in English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is no assumption of deep IT experience, but there is an assumption that the person interacts with computers in some capacity and has basic technical literacy. They should for example understand the concept of an "operating system." An A+ certification, or an intro to programming class for example, would more than adequately prepare someone for this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person completely unfamiliar with computing will need to supplement their reading as suggested throughout the text. There is a wealth of free and accurate information on IT fundamentals (e.g. compute, storage, networking, programming, etc) and this book seeks more to curate than replicate.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_emergence_means_formalization">Emergence means formalization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The emergence model seeks to define a likely order in which concerns are <strong>formalized</strong>. Any concern may of course arise at any time: the startup founder certainly is concerned with security!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Formalization means at least one or more of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dedicated resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dedicated organization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defined policies and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated tooling</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the author&#8217;s experience, for example, startups avoid formalized process and project management. To the extent the concerns exist, they are <em>tacit</em> (understood or implied; suggested; implicit). Certainly, a small startup does not invest in an enterprise-class service desk tool supporting a full array of IT management processes, or a full-blown Project Management Office with its own Vice President and associated portfolio automation. Simple work management, with a manual or automated Kanban board, is likely their choice for work management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But by the time they are a team of teams, specialization has emerged and more robust processes and tools are required. The danger of course is that the formalization effort may be driven by its own logic, and start to lose track of the all-critical business context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By careful examining these stages of maturation, and the industry responses to them, it is the author&#8217;s hope that the student will have effective tools to critically engage with the problem of scaling the digital organization.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="Sec-I"></a>
This is the introduction to Part I.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we  explore the fundamentals of information technology delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are working in a startup, alone or with one or two partners. You are always in the same room, easily able to carry on a running conversation about your efforts and progress. You have no time or resources to spend on anything except keeping your new system alive and running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 1: IT Value</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chapter 1 introduces you to the fundamental concepts of IT value that serve as a basis for the rest of the course. Why do people want computing (IT) services? What are the general outlines of their structure? How do they come into being? How are they changed over time?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this is essential to understand for your scenario; you need to understand what computers can do and how they are generally used, if you are going to create a product based on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter also covers the basics of how you&#8217;ll approach building a product. It&#8217;s assumed you won&#8217;t develop an intricate, long-range plan but rather will be experimenting with various ideas and looking for "fast feedback" on their success or failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 2: IT Infrastructure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, you have a general idea for a product and are ready to start building it. But not so fast&#8230;&#8203; you need to decide some fundamentals first. How will your new product run? What will you use to build it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not possible to begin construction until you decide on your tools. This chapter will provide you an overview of computing infrastructure including Cloud hosting and various approaches to system configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter also presents an overview of source control, as even your infrastructure depends on it in the new world of "infrastructure as code."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Application delivery</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you&#8217;re ready to start building something. While this is not a book on software development or programming languages, it&#8217;s important to understand some basics and at least see them in action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also the "DevOps" chapter; it&#8217;s not just about writing code, but about the entire end to end system that gets the code you are writing from your workstation, into collaborative environments, and finally to a state where it can be accessed by end users. From source repository to build manager to package repository to production, we&#8217;ll cover a basic toolchain that will help you understand modern industrial practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This section&#8217;s lab approach</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this is not a book about any particular computing language or platform, we need to describe some technical fundamentals. We’ll do so in as neutral a manner as possible. However, this books’ accompanying labs are based on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds to facilitate Linux development.</p>

<h3 id="Intro-Chap-1">Chapter 1. IT Value</h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_introduction">Introduction</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted at the outset, you are a small core of a startup. You are building a product of which IT is a significant part (otherwise why are you reading this book/in this class?) Your motivations are entrepreneurial; you want to create a successful business. You might be housed within a larger enterprise, but the thought experiment here is that you have substantial autonomy to order your efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You want to do something that has a unique IT component. Regardless of your business, you will need accounting and legal services at a minimum, and very quickly payroll and HR, and so forth. Those things can (and should) be purchased as commodity services, if you are a small entrepreneur (I am not aware of any convincing arguments to the contrary, unless you are absolutely on the smallest of shoestring budgets and can work 100 hour weeks). Your unique value proposition will be expressed to some degree in unique IT software. While this software may be based on well understood products, the configuration and logic you construct will be all your own. Because of this, you are now a producer (or soon to be) of IT services.</p>

<p>Before we can talk about building and managing information technology (IT), we need to understand what it is and why people want it. We&#8217;ll start this chapter by looking at an IT value experience that may seem very familiar. Then we&#8217;ll dig further into concepts like the "IT stack" and the "IT service" and how they change over time.</p>

<p>This is an introductory text. You may see terms below that are unfamiliar (Model-View-Controller, IP, packet switching). If you are reading this online, you can follow the links, but it&#8217;s not required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you progress in your career, you will always be encountering new terminology. Part of what you need to learn is when it&#8217;s important to dig into it, and when you can let it pass for a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should be able to understand the gist presented below that these are complex systems based on a wide variety of technologies, some of them old, some new.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The screen on her cell phone represents information accessed and presented via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller framework</a>, implemented in the latest version of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, running on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreter</a> that would have taxed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a> thirty years ago. The communication with her bank’s central systems is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)">4G LTE</a> data which in turn relies on the high-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP backbone</a> networks operated by the <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/telecom-carrier">telecommunications carriers</a>, based on research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet switching</a> now approaching 50 years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application operating on the cell phone interacts with core banking systems via sophisticated and highly secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">middleware</a>, crossing multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">network</a> control points. This middleware talks in turn to the customer demand deposit system that still runs on the mainframe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mainframe is now running the latest version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS">IBM’s zOS</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> (a direct descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors#MVT">OS/360</a>, one of the most  significant operating systems in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing">history of computing</a>). The "customer demand deposit" banking application running on the mainframe is still based on code written in the lowest level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembler</a>. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency. Although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio for such a project has to date not been favorable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud</a> data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a> are newer, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> is structured very differently, and the operating system is <a href="https://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.</p>

<p>The resulting value is clear:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In an earlier era, our user might have stayed in, for fear of bouncing a check, or might have gone out and dined beyond her means.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The phone line at the restaurant might have been busy, so she might have risked showing up with no reservation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before texting and social media, she might not have been able to reach her friends as easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without the traffic application she might have run into a huge midtown traffic jam and been half an hour late.</p>

<h5 id="_various_forms_of_it_value">Various forms of IT value</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we have seen, there are many ways in which digital systems deliver value. Some systems serve as the modern equivalent of file cabinets: massive and secure storage for financial transactions, insurance records, medical records, and the like. Other systems enable the transmission of information around the globe, whether as emails, web pages, voice calls, video on demand, or data to be displayed in a smart phone application ("app"). Some of these systems support engaged online communities and social interactions, with conversations, media sharing, and even massive online gaming ecosystems. Yet other systems enable penetrating analysis and insight, by examining the volumes of data contained in the first two kinds of systems for patterns and trends. Sophisticated statistical techniques and cutting edge approaches like neural network-based machine learning increase the insights our digital systems are capable of, at a seemingly exponential rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital technology generates value in both direct and indirect ways. People have long consumed (and paid for) communication services, such as telephone services. Broadcast entertainment was a different proposition, however. The "consumer" - the person with the radio or television - was not the "customer" - the person paying for the programming to go out over the airwaves. New business models sprung up to support the new media, through the sale of advertising air time. In other words, the value proposition was indirect, or at least took multiple parties to achieve: the listener, the broadcaster, and the advertiser. Finally, some of the best known uses of digital technology were and are very indirect - the above-mentioned banks and insurance agencies using the earliest computers to automate the work of thousands of typists and file clerks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From these early business models have evolved and blossomed myriads of creative applications of digital technology, for the benefit of human beings in their ongoing pursuit of happiness and security. We see the applications mentioned at the outset: online banking, messaging, restaurant reservation, and traffic systems. Beyond that we see the use of digital technology in nearly every aspect of life. (And I say "nearly" only because I am a cautious person.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital and information technology pervades all of the major industry verticals (manufacturing, agriculture, finance, retail, healthcare, transportation, services, and so on) and common industry functions (supply chain, human resources, corporate finance, and even IT itself).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital systems and technologies also are critical components of larger scale industrial, military, and aerospace systems. For better or worse, general purpose computers are increasingly found controlling safety-critical infrastructure, and serving as an intermediating layer between human actions and machine response. Robotic systems are based on software, and the Internet of Things ultimately will span billions of sensors and controllers in interconnected webs monitoring and adjusting all forms of complex operations across the planet.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_what_is_it_anyways">What is IT, anyways?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve started this book in the previous section by providing an example of digital or IT value, without much discussion of how it is delivered. This is deliberate. But what is IT (Information Technology), anyways?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The computers? The networks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people who run them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That organization under a Chief Information Officer that loves to say “no” and is always slow and expensive?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of these are how this book defines “IT.” Although this is not a technical book on computer science or software engineering, the intent is that it reflects and is compatible with foundational principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Information technology” is ultimately based on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, and the other pioneers who defined the central problems of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">digital logic</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">computer architecture</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="1.01.02-IT-as-function-2"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, as an organizational function, information technology also draws on organizational theory, systems theory, human factors and psychology, and more recent concepts such as design thinking, among many other areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussions of “information technology” become contentious because some think of the traditional organization, while others think of the general problem area. IT has a long history as a corporate function, a single hierarchy under a powerful Chief Information Officer. This model has had its dysfunctions, including a longstanding reputation for being slow and expensive. Often, when one encounters the term “IT,” the author using the term is referring to this organizational tradition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>We are less interested in the future of IT as a distinct organizational structure. There are many different models, from fully centralized to fully embedded.</strong> Organizational structure will be discussed in Chapter 7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this book, we define “Information technology” in terms of its historic origins. We look to IT’s common origins in automating the laborious and error prone processes of computation, through the application of digital logic technologies based on information transmission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of organizational form or delivery methods, IT is defined by these origins. And there are notable common threads throughout this problem domain: the fragility and complexity of these systems, the need for layered abstractions in their management, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It does not matter if the application developers ultimately report up through the CIO, the CMO, the CFO, or the COO. Their daily experience remains largely the same. The dynamics of their management remain the same. Executives who seek to take control of IT so they can “remove that old bureaucracy” are well advised to be cautious; the bureaucracy emerged for a reason. More on this in subsequent chapters.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT increasingly permeates business operations and social interactions. The breadth and depth of IT support for virtually all domains of society continues to expand. Lately, this is known as digital transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The role of information technology seems critical to society and the economy, but there are various points of view. Nicholas Carr, in his controversial <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article "IT Doesn&#8217;t Matter," recognized that IT was becoming commoditized in an important sense <a href="#Carr2003">[Carr2003]</a>. As Cloud providers started to offer utility-style computing, the choice of particular vendors of computers was no longer strategic. Looking to history, Carr argued that just as businesses no longer have “Vice Presidents for Electricity,” so businesses no longer need Chief Information Officers or dedicated IT departments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Carr has insight&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there is no question IT is becoming pervasive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but he ultimately reflects a narrow view of what “IT” is. If “IT” were merely computation at the lowest level&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just shuffling bits of information around, doing a little math&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then perhaps it could be embedded throughout a business like electricity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But IT has emergent aspects that are not comparable to electrical power. As it pervades all dimensions of business operations, it brings its concerns with it: complexity, fragility, and the skills required to cope with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One watt of electrical power is like any other watt of electrical power, and can usefully be seen as a commodity. We can use it to run toasters, hair dryers, or industrial paint mixers, and there is little concern (beyond supply and demand management) that the consumption of power by the paint mixer will affect the toaster.  It&#8217;s also true that one cycle of computing, in a certain sense, is like any other cycle. But information technology systems interact with each other in surprising and unpredictable ways, orders of magnitude more complex than electrical power grids. (This is not to imply the modern electrical grid is a simple system!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT also radically transforms industries: from retail to transportation to manufacturing to genetics. Applied software-centric IT is unleashing remarkable economic disruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lawyer may depend on a cell phone, and (in keeping with Carr) beyond its provision as a commodity service, needs little else to deliver the legal strategies a firm needs. A graphic designer may use computerized graphic tools, but these have become relatively standardized and commoditized in the past twenty years, and probably are not a source of competitive advantage in the quest for new marketing clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, consider a text analytic algorithm that replaces thousands of paralegals, resulting in order-of-magnitude more accurate legal research in a fraction of cost and time. This <strong>is</strong> strategic and disruptive to the legal community. A superior supply chain algorithm, and the ability to improve it on an ongoing basis, may indeed elevate a logistics firm’s performance above competitors. In cases like these&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and they seem to be increasing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;IT matters very much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the digitally transforming economy, traditional “back office” IT organizations find themselves called on to envision, develop, and support market-facing applications of IT. And what starts with one market-facing use case can quickly expand into entire portfolios.  It is such cases that are of particular concern in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, it is possible that IT is the <strong>most</strong> strategic capability an organization can invest in. As the editor in chief of <em>IEEE Software</em> notes <a href="#Spinellis2015">[Spinellis2015]</a>,</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
other industries are also producing what’s in effect software (executable knowledge) but not treating it as such . . . Although many industries have developed their own highly effective processes over the years, software engineering maintains an essential advantage. It has developed methods and tools that let even small teams manage extremely high complexity . . . This advantage is important because the complexity in non-software activities is also increasing inexorably . . . [T]he time has come to transform our world… by giving back to science and technology the knowledge software engineering has produced.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, how do we define an IT problem, as opposed to other kinds of business problems? An IT problem is any problem where you are primarily constrained by your capability and understanding of IT.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you need computer scientists or engineers who understand the fundamentals of information theory and computer science, you are doing IT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need people who understand when your information-centric problems might need to be referred to such theorists and engineers, you are likely doing IT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need people who are skilled in building upon those fundamentals, and operating technical platforms derived from them (such as programming languages, general purpose computers, and network routers), you are doing IT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of whether IT is housed under a traditional CIO, an operations capability, a Chief Marketing Officer, or a “line of business”, when it is critical to operations certain concerns inevitably follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Requirements (i.e. your intent for IT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sourcing and provisioning</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Executives who take control of information technology in hopes of making it more "agile" are often surprised to find that these concerns were not mere bureaucracy, but instead had well grounded origins in past failures. Ignoring these lessons is perilous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet, the traditional, process-heavy IT organization does seem dysfunctional from a business point of view: a central theme of this book.

<p>Let&#8217;s examine our diner&#8217;s value experience in more detail, without getting unnecessarily technical, and clarify some definitions along the way.  The first idea we need to cover is the "moment of truth." In terms of information technnology, this English-language cliché represents the user&#8217;s experience of value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the example, our friend seeking a relaxing night out had several moments of truth:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consulting her bank balance, and subsequent financial transactions also reflecting what was stated to her</p>

<p>In order to view her balance, our user is probably using an application downloaded from a "store" of applications made available to her device. On her device, this "app" is part of an intricate set of components performing functions such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>accepting "input" (user intent) through a screen or voice input</p>

<p>Of course, without the banking systems on the other end, there is no bank balance to transmit. These systems are similar, but on a much larger scale than our friend&#8217;s device:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Internet and middleware services to receive the request from the international network</p>

<li>
<p>Data services to store the user&#8217;s banking information (account identity and transactions) along with millions of other customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many additional services to detect fraud and security attacks, report on utilization, identify any errors in the systems, and much more.</p>

Our friend is seeking some value that IT uniquely can enable, but does not want to consider all the complexity that goes into it. She just wants to go out with friends. The moment of truth depends on the service; the service may contain great complexity, but part of its success lies in shielding the user from that complexity.</p>

<p>This fundamental tension between <strong>what</strong> a system is supposed to do, versus <strong>how</strong> it does it, pervades IT management and will likely define your career. "Don&#8217;t trouble me with the details, just give me the results" is the overall theme, and we encounter this reaction to complexity in many aspects of life.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Terminology is important. We need to have a more precise way of describing the information technology, beyond just saying there is "lots" of it. A variety of terms are used in this text:</p>

<p>In general, in this book, we will use the following definitions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An IT service is defined primarily in terms of WHAT not HOW</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defining an IT system may include a discussion of both WHAT it does and HOW it does it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An "application" usually means some IT service or system for end users who are not primarily concerned with IT other than wanting to get something done with it (e.g. go out to dinner)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Infrastructure" usually means some IT service or system that primarily supports OTHER IT services or systems (e.g. a network "service" is not usually useful to end users without additional application services.)</p>

<div class="title">Author&#8217;s note: Service versus product</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purposes of this book, "IT services" are equivalent to "products." You may in other contexts hear phrases like "products <strong>versus</strong> services" which imply that they are distinct. Usually, when products are contrasted with services, people are equating products with goods: a jar of peanut butter is a "product," while a haircut is a service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when I worked at AT&amp;T, the internal term for offerings like broadband networking access was not "service," but "product." Services, in this sense, <strong>are</strong> products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this book, we see products and services as roughly equivalent, but the two terms have some different connotations. Products usually imply an external market, where services can be either internal or external facing. While we certainly talk about "product marketing", the term "service marketing" is rarely seen. Furthermore,  some organizations such as Target have recently re-conceptualized internal services organizations as "product teams."</p>

<h4 id="service-lifecycle">The IT service lifecycle</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="service-lifecycle"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve established that the IT service is based on a complex stack of technology, from local devices to global networks to massive data centers. Software and hardware are layered together in endlessly inventive ways to solve problems people did not even know they had ten years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But these IT service systems must come from somewhere. They must be designed, built, and operated, and (as any smartphone user can testify) they are continually improved over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple representation of the IT service lifecycle is shown in the figure below.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>It starts with an idea. Someone has an insight into an IT-enabled value proposition that can make a profit, or better fulfill a mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea must garner support and resources so that it can be built.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea is then constructed, at least as an initial proof of concept or Minimum Viable Product (in the language of Ries' <em>Lean Startup</em>.) Construction is assumed to include an element of design; in this textbook, <strong>construction and design are not represented as two separate phases.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a critical state transition however that will always exist. Initially, it is the change from OFF to ON when the system is first constructed. After the system is ON, there are still distinct changes in state when new features are deployed, or incorrect behaviors ("bugs" or "defects") are rectified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system may be ON, but it is not delivering value until the user can access it. Sometimes, that may be as simple as providing someone with a network address, but usually there is some initial "provisioning" of system access to the user, who needs to identify themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system can then deliver services (moments of truth) to the end users. It may deliver millions or billions of such experiences, depending on its scale and how one might choose to count the subjective concept of value experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user may have access, but may still not receive value, if they do not understand the system well enough to use it. Whether via a formal service desk, or informal social media channels, users of IT services will require and seek support on how to maximize the value they are receiving from the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, support requests indicate that something is wrong with the system itself. If the system is no longer delivering value experiences (bank balances, restaurant reservations, traffic directions) then some action must be taken promptly to restore service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the previous states in the lifecycle generate data and insight that lead to further evolution of the system. There is a wide variety of ways systems may evolve: new user functionality, more stable technology, increased system capacity, and more. Such motivations result in new construction and changes to the existing system, and so the cycle begins again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;Unless&#8230;&#8203; the system&#8217;s time is at an end. If there is no reason for the system to exist any longer, it should be retired.</p>

<h4 id="consumer-customer-sponsor">Defining consumer, customer, and sponsor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="consumer-customer-sponsor"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In understanding IT value, it is essential to clarify the definitions of user, customer, and sponsor, and understand their perspectives and motivations. Sometimes, the user <strong>is</strong> the customer. But more often, the user and the customer are different, and one may additionally need to distinguish the role of system or service sponsor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following definitions may help</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>consumer</strong> (sometimes called the <strong>user</strong>) is the person actually interacting with the IT-based service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>customer</strong> is a source of revenue for the service. If the service is part of a profit center, the customer is the person actually purchasing the product (e.g. demand deposit banking.) If the service is part of a cost center (e.g. an HR system), the customer is best seen as an internal executive, as the actual revenue-producing customers are too far removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>sponsor</strong> is the person who authorizes and controls the funding used to construct and operate the service.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the service type, these roles can be filled by the same or different people. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>So, who paid for our user&#8217;s enjoyment? The bank and restaurant both had clear motivation for supporting a better online experience, and people now expect that service organizations provide this. The bank experiences less customer turnover and increased likelihood that customers add additional services. The restaurant sees increased traffic and smoother flow from more efficient reservations. Both see increased competitiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The traffic application is a somewhat different story. While it is an engineering marvel, there is still some question as to how to fund it long term. It requires a large user base to operate, and yet end consumers of the service are unlikely to pay for it. At this writing, the service draws on advertising dollars from businesses wishing to advertise to passersby, and also sells its real-time data on traffic patterns to a variety of customers, such as developers considering investments along given routes.</p>

<p>Like the proverbial fish that doesn&#8217;t understand water (because water it all it knows), we may lose sight of the laws and customs that enable us to use computers in the ways covered in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the ability for banks to hold money as electronic bits on a computer is rooted in the earliest history of banking and the emergence of centralized settlement and clearing mechanisms. Cell phone companies rely on international treaties, and national laws and regulations allocating radio spectrum.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The existence of physical voice and data connectivity relies on laws supporting utility easements and rights of way, and even treaties such as the Law of the Sea (how is it that undersea cables remain unmolested?).</p>

<p>As you consider embarking on a journey of IT value, you need to orient to your surroundings and create an initial proposal or plan for how you will proceed. If you are actually a startup, you need a business plan. If you are working as an intrapreneur in a larger organization, you will still need some kind of formal proposal. This section describes some tools and thinking approaches that may be useful at this very earliest stage.

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_market_facing_supporting_back_office">Market facing, supporting, back office</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Chapter 1 we discussed the question of "who pays/who benefits" for the service, <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_consumer_customer_and_sponsor">proposing that</a> the service consumer, the service customer, and the service sponsor might be three distinct roles (sometimes collapsing into 2 or 1 individual.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see this again in how we can categorize the "customers" of IT services and systems. Roughly, such services can be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Directly market- and consumer-facing (e.g. Facebook), to be used by external consumers and paid for by either them or closely associated customers (e.g. Netflix, or an online banking system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer "supporting" systems, such as the online system that a bank teller uses when interacting with a customer. Customers do not interact directly with such systems, but customer-facing representatives do, and problems with such systems may be readily apparent to the end customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completely "back-office" systems (HR, payroll, marketing, etc)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note however, that (especially in the current digitally transforming market) a service previously thought of as "back office" (when run internally) becomes "market-facing" when developed as a profit-seeking offering. For example, an HR system built internally is "back office," but Workday is a directly market-facing product, even though the two services may be similar in functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s all relative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Especially when products are <strong>not</strong> market facing, we start to run into the problem of distinguishing <a href="#discovery-v-design">discovery versus design</a>, as we discuss below.</p>

<h5 id="_diffusion_theory_and_other_approaches">Diffusion theory and other approaches</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you start to think about digital value, you must think about the context for your startup or product idea. What is the likelihood of its being adopted? Is it part of a broader "movement" of technological innovation? Where is the customer base in terms of its willingness to adopt the innovation? A well known approach is the idea of the "diffusion theory," first researched by Everett Rogers and proposed in his <em>Diffusion of Innovations,</em> <a href="#Rogers2003">[Rogers2003]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rogers' research proposed the idea of "Adopter Categorization on the Basis of Innovativeness," with a well-known graphic:</p>

<p>Rogers went on to characterize the various stages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Innovators: Venturesome risk-takers</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll see this diagram often, but you should be aware that Rogers himself (the person who has researched the data) says that (p.282):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Past research shows no support for this claim of a “chasm” between certain adopter categories. On the contrary, innovativeness, if measured properly, is a continuous variable and there are no sharp breaks or discontinuities between adjacent adopter categories (although there are important differences between them)</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea of technology diffusion frames the problem for us, but we need more. Steve Blank, in his influential book <em>The Four Steps to Epiphany</em> <a href="#Blank2013">[Blank2013]</a>, argues there are four categories for startups (p.31):</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Startups that want to re-segment an existing market as a niche player</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding which category you are attempting is critical, because "the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance."</p>

<p>One recent book that&#8217;s been influential among enterpreneurs is Alex Osterwalder&#8217;s <em>Business Model Generation</em> <a href="#Osterwalder2010">[Osterwalder2010]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book is perhaps best known for introducing the concept of the Business Model Canvas, which it defines as "A shared language for describing, visualizing, assessing, and changing business models."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Business Model Canvas uses 9 major categories to describe the business model:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Key Partners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Key Activities</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we discussed the basic questions of information technology value and how it is experienced and developed. Through the mechanism of a hypothetical modern IT user, we covered (at a <strong>very</strong> high level) the necessary ingredients of the IT experience. We considered the user&#8217;s moment of truth, and the massive IT complexity that sustains it. We also discussed a high level lifecycle model for IT applications and services, and explored some initial definitions for user, customer, and sponsor - critical distinctions to make in an age of digital transformation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the Part Introduction, you cannot start developing a product until you decide what you will build it with. (You may have a difficult time writing an app for a mobile phone if you choose the COBOL programming language!)  You also need to understand something of how computers are operated, enough so that you can make decisions on how your system will run. Most startups choose to run IT services on infrastructure owned by a Cloud provider, but there are other options. Certainly, as you scale up, you&#8217;ll need to be more and more sophisticated in your understanding of your underlying IT services.</p>

<h4 id="_infrastructure_overview">Infrastructure overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous chapter, you were introduced to the concept of a Moment of Truth, and in the final exercises asked to think of a product idea. Some part of that product requires writing software, or at least configuring some IT-centric system. (IT being defined as in <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_information_technology">Chapter 1</a>.) You presumably have some resources (time and money). It’s Monday morning, you have cleared all distractions, shut down your Twitter and Facebook feeds, and are ready to start building.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not so fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can start writing code, you need some kind of a platform. It&#8217;s hard to build before you decide on your tools. You need to decide what language you are going to write in, or what framework you are going to configure, and how that effort is going to result in an operational system capable of rendering IT services. You are probably swimming in a sea of advice and options regarding your technical choices. In previous decades, books such as this might have gone into the specifics of particular platforms: mainframe vs. minicomputers, COBOL vs Fortran, Windows vs Unix, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this writing, JavaScript is a leading choice, in conjunction with various frameworks and NoSQL options (e.g. the MEAN stack, for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js), but millions of developers are still writing Java and .Net, and Ruby and Python have significant followings. Linux is arguably the leading platform, but commercial Unix and Microsoft platforms are still strong. And, periodically it&#8217;s reported that the majority of the world&#8217;s transactions <strong>still</strong> run on <a href="http://blog.hackerrank.com/the-inevitable-return-of-cobol/">COBOL-based systems</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in the past few years, some powerful infrastructure concepts have solidified that are independent of particular platforms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automation and “infrastructure as code”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The centrality of source control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of package management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy-based infrastructure management</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(We&#8217;ll get to test-driven development, pipeline automation &amp; DevOps in the next chapter.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might seem like a detour - you are in a hurry to start writing code! But industry practice is clear. You check your code into source control from Day One. You define your server configurations as recipes, manifests, or at least shell scripts, and check those definitions into source control as well. You keep track of what you have downloaded from the Internet and what version of stuff you are using, through package management (which uses different tools than source control). Always downloading the “latest” package from its upstream creator might seem like the way to stay current, but it will kill you when stuff works on one server but not on another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, you need to understand a few things and make a few decisions that you will be living with for a while, and will not be easily changed.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_what_is_infrastructure">What is Infrastructure?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Infrastructure is a tricky word. Google defines it thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>￼<em>The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, and power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, it connotes the stuff behind the scenes, the things you need but don’t want to spend a lot of time thinking about. We will spend a lot of time examining what we mean by “infrastructure” in this book, as it is fundamental to understanding the “business of IT.” This book defines “IT infrastructure” recursively as “the set of IT concerns that are of particular interest to IT.”</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An application or business service is consumed by people who are NOT primarily concerned with IT. For example, a customer-facing online banking service is consumed by end users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An IT infrastructure service is a service consumed by other IT-centric teams and capabilities. For example, a database or a load balancing service is consumed by other IT teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT infrastructure is one form of infrastructure. Other kinds of infrastructure might include mechanical, electrical, and plant investments (ME &amp; P). IT infrastructure, like IT itself, is defined by its fundamental dependence on information and computing theory [link Chapter 1].</p>

Today’s application becomes tomorrow’s infrastructure. Forty years ago, building an “application” would have included building its database, perhaps even its file management. This was rightly determined to be a general-case problem that could be the basis for commodity software, and so companies like Oracle were born.<br>
<br>
Operating systems took on more and more functionality, technology became more and more reliable and easily configured, and once unique (and competitively differentiating) functionality became commoditized and more and more deeply buried in the “stack”: the IT infrastructure.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many books (some in the Further Reading section for this chapter) on all aspects of IT infrastructure, which is a broad and deep topic. Our discussion of it here has to be high level, as appropriate for a survey course. We&#8217;ve established <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_information_technology">what we mean by IT generally</a>. Pragmatically, there are three major physical aspects to "IT infrastructure" relevant to the practitioner:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Computing cycles (sometimes called just "compute")</p>
</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Networking &amp; communications (or "network")</p>

<p>We will discuss a variety of subsidiary concerns and concepts, but those are the big three.</p>

<p>If we have a picture of our friend, and we use a digital filter to adjust the brightness, that is an application of compute power. The picture is made up of "pixels" which are nothing but numbers representing the color of some tiny square of the picture. Each of those numbers needs to be evaluated and the brightness adjusted. There may be millions in a single image.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that the pixel values range from 1 to 10, with 1 being the darkest and 10 being the lightest (in reality, the range is much larger.) To brighten a picture, we might tell the computer:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Look at a pixel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is between 0 and 3 add 2</p>

<li>
<p>If it is between 4 and 6 add 1</p>

<p>Move to a new pixel</p>

<li>
<p>Repeat the above 4 lines until all pixels are done</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a more realistic level, the process might be executed as a batch on a workstation, for hundreds or thousands of photos at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computers process instructions at the level of "true" and "false," represented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> "1s" and "0s." Because humans cannot easily understand binary data and processing, higher-level abstractions of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine code</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a> are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Computer processing is not free. Moving data from one point to another - the fundamental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission">transmission of information</a> - requires matter and energy, and is bound up in physical reality and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a>. The same applies for changing the state of data, which usually involves moving it somewhere, operating on it, and returning it to its original location. In the real world, even running the simplest calculation has physical and therefore economic cost, and so we must pay for computing.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong> But where did the picture come from? The data comprising the pixels needs to be stored somewhere. Sometimes you will hear the technical term "persisted." The combined set of pixels and their precise values can be termed the "state" of the photograph; the digital logic of the filter alters the state, and also needs to save this new state somewhere (otherwise it will be lost).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many technologies <a href="http://www.zetta.net/history-of-computer-storage/">have been used for digital storage.</a> Increasingly, the IT professional need not be concerned with the physical infrastructure used for storing data. As we will cover in the next section, storage increasingly is experienced as a virtual resource, accessed through executing programmed logic on Cloud platforms. "Underneath the covers" the Cloud provider might be using various forms of storage, from RAM to solid state drives to tapes, but the end user is,  <strong>ideally</strong>, shielded from the implementation details (part of the definition of a service).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is important to understand that in general, storage follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy">hierarchy</a>. Just as we might "store" a document by holding it in our hands, setting it on a desktop, filing it in a cabinet, or archiving it in a banker&#8217;s box in an offsite warehouse, so computer storage also has different levels of speed and accessibility:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On-chip registers and cache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Random-access memory (RAM), aka "main memory"</p>

<p><strong>Network</strong>
We can change the state of some data, or store it. We also need to move it. This is the basic concern of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">networking</a>, to transmit data (or information) from one location to another. If you use your cell phone to look up your bank balance, there is network involved - otherwise, how did the data get from the bank&#8217;s computer in New Jersey to your cell phone in Minnesota? We see evidence of networking every day; you may be familiar with coaxial cables for TV, or telephone lines strung from pole to pole in many areas. However, like storage, there is also a hierarchy of networking:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intra-chip pathways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">Motherboard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane">backplane</a> circuits</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backbone_network">Backbone networks</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And like storage and compute, networking as a service increasingly is independent of implementation. The developer uses programmatic tools to define expected information transmission, and (again <strong>ideally</strong>) need not be concerned with the specific networking technologies or architectures serving their needs.</p>

Eventually, scale matters. As your IT service&#8217;s usage increases, you will inevitably find that you need to start caring about technical details such as storage and network architecture. The implementation decisions made by you and your service providers may become inefficient for the particular "workload" your product represents, and you will need to start asking questions. The brief technical writeup, <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">Latency Numbers Every Programmer Should Know</a> can help you start thinking about these issues.

<p>There is ferocious turbulence in the IT infrastructure market. Cloud technologies, DevOps, various platform wars… As an entrepreneur, you need to understand what technical trends matter and what are more of same. In particular, you will need to make some level of commitment to your technical architecture. And at some point you <strong>WILL</strong> be asked, “You’re still using that old technology?” As a startup, you have a couple initial decisions to make regarding infrastructure and tools:</p>

<p>As a startup, it would seem likely that you would use a commodity cloud provider. This text is based on this assumption (physical IT asset management will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4), but is there any reason why that would not work for you? The two questions are related. If you want to develop on a LAMP stack, you need a Cloud provider that will support you in this. While most are very flexible, you will need to consider the specific support levels they are offering; a provider that supports the platform (and not just the operating system) might be more valuable, but there may be higher costs and other tradeoffs. There is a near-infinite amount of material, debate, discussion, books, blogs, lists, and so forth concerning choice of language and platform. Exploring this area is not the purpose of this book. However, this book has certain assumptions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your system will be built, at least in part, with some form of programming language which is human-readable and compiled or interpreted into binary instructions.</p>

<li>
<p>Your system will run on general purpose digital computers using well known technologies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your computing environment is networked in a standard way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You use the concept of a software pipeline, in which new functionality is developed in a scope distinct from what is currently offered as your product/service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New functionality moves through the pipeline at significant volumes and velocity and you are concerned with optimizing this overall flow.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear, in defining a product (Chapter 1) you already have started to think about requirements, although we have not yet started to use that term. The idea that all requirements need to be understood in detail before considering technical platform is, in general, an outmoded concept that made more sense when hardware was more specialized and only available as expensive, organization-owned assets. With the emergence of Cloud providers able to sell computing services, companies no longer need to commit to large capital outlays. And digital product professionals realize that requirements are never fully "understood" up front (more on this in the next chapter). Your Minimum Marketable Feature is an initial statement of requirements from which you should be able to infer at least initial toolset and platform requirements.

<p>Ruby on Rails is another frequently-encountered platform. If you are building a data or analytics-centric product, there are other alternatives as well. There is a good reason, however, why you should not spend too much time “analyzing” before you make platform decisions. The reality is that you cannot know all of the factors necessary to make a perfect decision, and in fact the way you will learn them is by moving forward and testing out various approaches. So, choose Ruby on Rails, or LAMP, or MEAN, and a hosting provider who supports them, and start. You can easily stand up environments for comparison using Cloud services, or even with lightweight virtualization on your own personal laptop. Do not fall into analysis paralysis. But <strong>be critical of everything</strong> especially in your first few weeks of development. Ask yourself:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtualization">Virtualization</a>, for the purposes of this section, starts with the idea of a computer within a computer. (It has applicability to storage and networking as well but we will skip that for now.) In order to understand this, we need to understand a little bit about operating systems and how they relate to the physical computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assume a simple, physical computer such as a laptop. When the laptop is first turned on, the operating system (OS) loads; the OS is itself software, but is able to directly control the computer&#8217;s physical resources: its central processing unit (CPU), memory, screen, and any interfaces such as WiFi, USB, and Bluetooth. The operating system (in a traditional approach) then is used to run "applications" such as Web browsers, media players, word processors, spreadsheets, and the like. Many such programs can also be run as applications within the browser, but the browser still needs to be run as an application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the simplest form of virtualization, a specialized application known as a <em>hypervisor</em> is loaded like any other application. The purpose of this hypervisor is to emulate the hardware computer in software. Once the hypervisor is running, it can emulate any number of "virtual" computers, each of which can have its own operating system. The hypervisor mediates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> (VM) access to the actual, physical hardware of the laptop; the VM can take input from the USB port, and output to the Bluetooth interface, just like the master OS that launched when the laptop was turned on.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two different kinds of hypervisors. The example we just discussed was an example of a Type 2 hypervisor, which runs on top of a host operating system. In a Type 1 hypervisor, a master host OS is not used; the hypervisor runs on the "bare metal" of the computer and in turn "hosts" multiple VMs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Paravirtualization</em>, e.g. containers, is another form of virtualization found in the marketplace. In a paravirtualized environment, a core operating system is able to abstract hardware resources for multiple virtual guest environments without having to virtualize hardware for each guest. The benefit of this type of virtualization is increased input/output (I/O) efficiency and performance for each of the guest environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, while hypervisors can support a diverse array of virtual machines with different operating systems on a single computing node, guest environments in a paravirtualized system generally share a single OS.</p>

<h5 id="_why_is_virtualization_important">Why is virtualization important?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Virtualization attracted business attention as a means to consolidate computing workloads. For years, companies would purchase servers to run applications of various sizes, and in many cases the computers were badly underutilized. Because of configuration issues (legitimate) and an overabundance of caution (questionable), average utilization in a pre-virtualization data center might average 10-20%. (That&#8217;s 90% of the computer&#8217;s capacity being wasted.)</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above figure is a simplification. Computing and storage infrastructure supporting each application stack in the business were sized to support each workload. For example, a payroll server might run on a different infrastructure configuration than a data warehouse server. Large enterprises needed to support hundreds of different infrastructure configurations, increasing maintenance and support costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adoption of virtualization allowed businesses to compress multiple application workloads onto a smaller number of physical servers:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In most virtualized architectures, the physical servers supporting workloads share a consistent configuration, which made it easy to add and remove resources from the environment. The virtual machines may still vary greatly in configuration, but the fact of virtualization makes managing that easier - the virtual machines can be easily copied and moved, and increasingly can be defined as a form of code (see next section).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Virtualization thus introduced a new design pattern into the enterprise where computing and storage infrastructure became commoditized building blocks supporting an ever-increasing array of services. But what about where the application is large and virtualization is mostly overhead? Virtualization still may make sense in terms of management consistency and ease of system recovery.</p>

<h5 id="_virtualization_managed_services_and_cloud">Virtualization, managed services, and cloud</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Companies have always sought alternatives to owning their own computers.  is a long tradition of managed services, where applications are built out by a customer and then their management is outsourced to a third party. Using fractions of mainframe "time-sharing" systems is a practice that dates back decades. However, such relationships took effort to set up and manage, and might even require bringing physical tapes to the third party (sometimes called a "service bureau.") Fixed price commitments were usually high (the customer had to guarantee to spend X dollars.) Such relationships left much to be desired in terms of  responsiveness to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As computers became cheaper, companies increasingly acquired their own data centers, investing large amounts of capital in high-technology spaces with extensive power and cooling infrastructure. This was the trend through the late 1980s to about 2010, when Cloud computing started to provide a realistic alternative with true "pay as you go" pricing, analogous to electric metering.</p>

<p>The idea of running IT completely as a utility service goes back at least to 1965 and the publication of <em>The Challenge of the Computer Utility</em>, by Douglas Parkhill. While the conceptual idea of Cloud and utility computing was foreseeable fifty years ago, it took many years of hard-won IT evolution to support the vision. Reliable hardware of exponentially increasing performance, robust open-source software, Internet backbones of massive speed and capacity, and many other factors converged towards this end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, people store data - often private - on computers. In order to deliver compute as a utility, it is essential to segregate each customer&#8217;s workload from all others. This is called <em>multi-tenancy</em>. In multi-tenancy, multiple customers share physical resources that provide the illusion of being dedicated.</p>

<p>In order to run compute as a utility, multi-tenancy was essential. This is different from electricity (but similar to the phone system).

<p>Virtualization is necessary, but not sufficient for cloud. True Cloud services are highly automated, and most Cloud analysts will insist that if virtual machines cannot be created and configured in a completely automated fashion, the service is not true Cloud.

<blockquote>
Infrastructure as code is an approach to infrastructure automation based on practices from software development. It emphasizes consistent, repeatable routines for provisioning and changing systems and their configuration. Changes are made to definitions and then rolled out to systems through unattended processes that include thorough validation. The premise is that modern tooling can treat infrastructure as if it were software and data. This allows people to apply software development tools such as version control systems (VCS), automated testing libraries, and deployment orchestration to manage infrastructure. It also opens the door to exploit development practices such as test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration (CI), and continuous delivery (CD).

<cite>Infrastructure as Code: Managing Servers in the Cloud</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is infrastructure as code?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As cloud infrastructures have scaled, there has been an increasing need to configure many servers identically. Auto-scaling (adding more servers in response to increasing load) has become a widely used strategy as well. Both call for increased automation in the provisioning of IT infrastructure. It is simply not possible for a human being to be hands on at all times in configuring and enabling such infrastructures, so automation is called for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In years past, infrastructure administrators relied on ad-hoc issuance of commands either at an operations console, or via a GUI-based application. Shell scripts might be used for various repetitive processes, but administrators by tradition and culture were empowered to issue arbitrary commands to alter the state of the running system directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following passage from The Phoenix Project captures some of the issues. The speaker is Wes, the infrastructure manager, who is discussing a troubleshooting scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>“Several months ago, we were three hours into a Sev 1 outage, and we bent over backward not to escalate to Brent. But eventually, we got to a point where we were just out of ideas, and we were starting to make things worse. So, we put Brent on the problem.” He shakes his head, recalling the memory, “He sat down at the keyboard, and it’s like he went into this trance. Ten minutes later, the problem is fixed. Everyone is happy and relieved that the system came back up. But then someone asked, ‘How did you do it?’ And I swear to God, Brent just looked back at him blankly and said, ‘I have no idea. I just did it.’”</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#Kim2013">[Kim2013]</a>, p. 116.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously, “close your eyes and go into a trance” is not a repeatable process. It is not a procedure or operation that can be archived and distributed across multiple servers. So, shell scripts or more advanced forms of automation are written and increasingly, all actual server configuration is based on such pre-developed specification. It is becoming more and more rare for a systems administrator to actually “log in” to a server and execute configuration-changing commands in an ad-hoc manner (as Brent).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, because virtualization is becoming so powerful, servers increasingly are destroyed and rebuilt at the first sign of any trouble. In this way, it is certain that the server’s configuration is as intended. This again is a relatively new practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previously, because of the expense and complexity of bare-metal servers, and the cost of having them offline, great pains were taken to fix troubled servers. Systems administrators would spend hours or days troubleshooting obscure configuration problems, such as residual settings left by removed software. Certain servers might start to develop “personalities.” Industry practice has changed dramatically here since around 2010.</p>

<p>In presenting infrastructure as code at its simplest, we will start with the concept of a shell script. While this is not a deep Linux book (there are many others out there, starting with the excellent O’Reilly lineup), some basic technical literacy is assumed in this book. Consider the following set of commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ mkdir foo bar
$ cd foo
$ touch x y z
$ cd ../bar
$ touch a b c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this do? It tells the computer:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Create (<code>mkdir</code>) two directories, one named foo and one named bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move (<code>cd</code>) to the one named foo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create (<code>touch</code>) three files, named x, y, and z</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move to the directory named bar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create three blank files, named a, b, and c.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find yourself (with the appropriate permissions) at a Unix command prompt, and run those commands, you will wind up with a configuration that could be visualized as this:</p>

<p>(If you don’t understand this, you should probably spend a couple hours with a Linux tutorial).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configuration, you ask? Something this trivial? Yes, directory and file layouts count as configuration and in some cases are critical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, what if we take that same set of commands, and put them in a file thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>#!/bin/bash
mkdir foo bar
cd foo
touch x y z
cd ../bar
touch a b c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We might name that file <code>iac.sh</code>, set its permissions correctly, and run it (so that the computer executes all the commands for us, rather than us running them one at a time at the console).  If we did so in an empty directory, we’d again wind up with that same configuration. (If we did it in a directory already containing foo and bar directories, we’d get errors. More on this to come.)</p>

<p>This will be familiar material to many of you, including the fact that beyond creating directories and files we can use shell scripts to create and destroy virtual servers, install and remove software, set up and delete users, check on the status of running processes, and much more.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sophisticated infrastructure as code techniques are are essential part of modern site reliability engineering practices such as used by Google. Auto-scaling, self-healing systems, fast deployments of new features all require that infrastructure be represented as code for maximum speed and reliability of creation.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s return to our iac.sh file. It’s valuable. It documents our intentions for how this configuration should look. We can reliably run it on thousands of machines and it will always give us two directories and six files. In terms of the previous section, we might choose to run it on every new server we create. We want to establish it as a known resource in our technical ecosystem. This is where version control and the broader concept of configuration management come in.</p>

<div class="title">Cattle not pets?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In earlier times, servers (that is, computers managed on a distributed network) were usually configured without virtualization. They arrived (carefully packed on pallets) from the manufacturer unconfigured, and would be painstakingly "built" by the systems administrator: the operating system would be compiled and installed, key software packages (such as Java) installed, and then the organization&#8217;s customer software installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At best, the systems administrators, or server engineers, might have written guidelines or perhaps some shell scripts that would be run on the server to configure it in a semi-consistent way. But that documentation would often be out of date, the scripts would be unique to a given administrator, and there would be great reluctance to "rebuild the box" - that is, to delete everything on it and do a "clean re-install." Instead, if there were problems, the administrator would try to fix the server by going in and adjusting particular settings (typically by changing configuration files and restarting services), or deleting software packages and re-installing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with this is that modern computing systems are so complex that deleting software can be difficult; if the un-install process fails in some way, the server can be left in a compromised state. Similarly, one-time configuration adjustments made to one server means that it may be inconsistent with similar devices, and this can cause problems. For example, if the first systems administrator is on vacation, their substitute may expect the server to be configured in a certain way and make adjustments that have unexpected effects. Or the first systems administrator themselves may forget exactly what it is they did. Through such practices, servers would start to develop personalities, because their configurations were inconsistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As people started to work more and more with virtualization, they realized it was easier to rebuild virtual servers from scratch, rather than trying to fix them. Automated configuration management tools helped by promoting a consistent process for rebuilding. Randy Bias, noting this, put forth the provocative idea that "servers are cattle, not pets" <a href="#Bias2012">[Bias2012]</a>. That is, when a pet is sick, one takes it to the vet, but a sick cow might simply  be taken out and shot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I prefer the saying that "servers are fleet vehicles, not collectible cars" as it seems less cruel, and Bias overlooked the fact that large animal veterinarians are routinely employed in the cattle industry.</p>

<p>Configuration management is a critically important practice in digital systems, and has always been so. How it is performed has evolved over time. At this stage in our journey, we are one or two people in a startup, working with digital artifacts such as our <a href="#infra-code-example">iac.sh example</a> discussed in the previous section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One or two people can achieve an impressive amount with modern digital platforms. But the work is complex. Tracking and controlling your work products as they evolve through change after change is important from day one of your efforts. It&#8217;s not something you want to put off to "later when I have time." This applies to computer code, configurations, and increasingly even documentation (often written in a lightweight markup language like Markdown or Asciidoc).</p>

In software development, version control is the foundation of every other Agile technical practice. Without version control, there is no build, no TDD, no continuous integration.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Agile Alliance indicates “version control” as one of the <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/subway.html">four foundational areas of Agile</a>, along with team, iterative development, and incremental development. Why is this? Version control is critical for any kind of system with complex, changing content, especially when many people are working on that content. Version control provides the capability of seeing the exact sequence of a complex system&#8217;s evolution and isolating any particular moment in its history, or providing detailed analysis on how two versions differ. With version control, we can understand what changed and when, which is essential to coping with complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While version control was always deemed important for software artifacts, it has only recently become the preferred paradigm for managing infrastructure state as well.  Because of this, version control is possibly the first IT management system you should acquire and implement (perhaps as a cloud service, such as Github).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version control in recent years increasingly distinguishes between source and package management: the management of binary files, as distinct from human-understandable symbolic files. There is also a need to understand what versions are installed on what computers; this can be termed "deployment management." (With the advent of containers, this is a particularly fast changing area.)</p>

<p>Version control works like an advanced file system with a memory. (Actual file systems that do this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versioning_file_system"><em>versioning</em></a> file systems.) It can remember all the changes you make to its contents, tell you the differences between any two versions, and also bring back the version you had at any point in time. Version control is important - but how important? Survey research presented in the annual State of DevOps report indicates that version control is one of the most critical practices associated with high performing IT organizations <a href="#Forsgren2016">[Forsgren2016]</a>. Nicole Forsgren <a href="#Forsgren2016a">[Forsgren2016a]</a>  summarizes the practice of version control as:</p>

<h6 id="_source_control">Source control</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital systems start with text files, typically encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>. Text editors create source code, scripts, and configuration files. These may be transformed in defined ways (e.g. by compilers and build tools) but the human understandable end of the process is mostly based on text files. In the previous section, we described a <a href="#infra-code-example">simple script</a> that altered the state of a computer system. We care very much about when such a text file changes. One wrong character can completely alter the behavior of a large, complex system. Therefore, our configuration management approach must track to that level of detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source control is at its most powerful when dealing with textual data. It is less useful in dealing with  binary data, such as image files. Text files can analyzed for their differences in an easy to understand way. If I change "abc" to "abcd" it is clear that the third character has been changed from “c” to “d.” On the other hand, if I take a picture (e.g. as a *.png file) and alter one pixel, and compare the resulting before and after binary files in terms of their data, it would be more difficult to understand what had changed. I might be able to easily tell that they are two different files, but they would look very similar and the difference in the binary data might be difficult to understand. Here is a detailed demonstration, using the command line in Ubuntu Linux. (Don&#8217;t worry, we will explain what is going on.)</p>

<h6 id="_the_commit_concept">The "commit" concept</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although implementation details may differ, all version control systems have some concept of “commit.” As stated in <em>Version Control with Git</em> <a href="#Loeliger2009">[Loeliger2009]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>In Git, a commit is used to record changes to a repository… Every Git commit represents a single, <strong>atomic</strong> changeset with respect to the previous state. Regardless of the number of directories, files, lines, or bytes that change with a commit… either all changes apply or none do.</em> [emphasis added]</p>

*Why "atomic"? The word atomic derives from the ancient Latin language, and means "indivisible." An atomic set of changes is either entirely applied, or entirely rejected. Atomicity is an important concept in computing, and transaction processing in particular. If our user tries to move money from her savings to her checking account, two operations are required: (1) reduce savings and (2) increase checking. Either both need to succeed, or both need to fail. That is the classic definition of an "atomic" transaction. Version control commits should be atomic.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of a version or source control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(data_management)">“commit”</a> is a rich foundation for IT management and governance. It both represents the state of the computing system as well as providing evidence of the human activity affecting it. As we will see in Chapter 3, the “commit” identifier is directly referenced by build activity, which in turn is referenced by the release activity, which is typically visible across the IT value chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the concept of an atomic “commit” is essential to the concept of a “branch” - the creation of an experimental version, completely separate from the main version, so that various alterations can be tried without compromising the overall system stability. Starting at the point of a “commit,” the branched version also becomes evidence of human activity around a potential future for the system. In some environments, the branch is automatically created with the assignment of a requirement or story - again, more on this to come in chapter 3. In other environments, the very concept of branching is avoided.</p>

<p>In some organizations, it was once common for compiled binaries to be stored in the same repositories as source code. However, this is no longer considered a best practice. Source and package management are now viewed as two separate things.  Source repositories should be reserved for text-based artifacts whose differences can be made visible in a human-understandable way. Package repositories in contrast are for binary artifacts that can be deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Package repositories also can serve as a proxy to the external world of downloadable software. That is, they are a cache, an intermediate store of the software provided by various "upstream" sources. For example, developers may be told to download the approved Ruby on Rails version from the local package repository, rather than going to the getting the latest version, which may not be suitable for the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Package repositories are also used to enable collaboration between teams working on large systems. Teams can check in their built components into the package repository for other teams to download. This is more efficient than everyone  always building all parts of the application from the source repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The boundary between source and package is not hard and fast, however. One does see binary files in source repositories, such as images used in an application. Also, when interpreted languages (such as Javascript) are "packaged," they still appear in the package as text files, perhaps compressed or otherwise incorporated into some larger containing structure.</p>

<p>Version control is an important part of the overall concept of configuration management.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we turned to source control, we looked at a <a href="#infra-code-example">simple script</a> that changed the configuration of a computer. It did so in an <em>imperative</em> fashion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imperative and declarative are two important terms from computer science. In an imperative approach, we tell the computer specifically how we want to accomplish a task, e.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Create a directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create some files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create another directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create more files</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so on. Many traditional programming languages take an imperative approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, with a declarative approach, we tell the computer the task we want to accomplish and let the computer figure out the best way to do it. Structured Query Language (SQL) statements are a good example of a declarative approach. We can provide a database system with a set of SQL statements, and the database will generate an execution plan to provide us with the data we are seeking. Functional languages such as Lisp and Erlang are considered declarative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A script such as <a href="#infra-code-example">iac.sh example</a> is executed line by line, i.e., it is imperative. But the state of the art in infrastructure as code is policy-based approaches, in which the object is to define the desired end state of the resource, not the steps needed to get there. Instead of defining a set of steps, a policy-based approach simply defines the proper configuration as a target, saying (in essence) that "this computer should always have a directory structure thus; do what you need to do to make it so and keep it this way":</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">

<pre>.
├── bar

│   └── c
└── foo
    ├── x

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More practically, imperative approaches are used to ensure that the proper versions of software are always present on a system, and that configurations such as Internet ports and security settings do not vary from the intended specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a complex topic and there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. (See "When and Where Order Matters" by Mark Burgess for an advanced discussion <a href="#Burgess2016">[Burgess2016]</a>.) But policy-based approaches seem to have the upper hand for now.</p>

The term “meta” implies a concept that is somehow self-referential, and/or operating at a higher level of abstraction. So,</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the term meta-discussion is a discussion about the discussion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meta-cognition is cognition about cognition, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meta-data (aka metadata) is data about data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In traditional data management, metadata is the description of the data structures, especially from a business point of view. A database column might be named “CUST_L_NM,” but the business description or metadata would be “The last, family, or surname of the customer.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In document management, the document metadata is the record of who created the document and when, when it was last updated, and so forth. Failure to properly sanitize document metadata has led to various privacy and data security related issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In telephony,  “data” is the actual call signal — the audio of the phone conversation, nowadays usually digitally encoded. Metadata on the other hand is all the information about the call: from who to who, when, how long, and so forth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In computer systems, metadata can be difficult to isolate. Sometimes, computing professionals will speak of a “metadata” layer that may define physical database structures, data extracts, business process behavior, even file locations. The trouble is, from a computer’s point of view, a processing instruction is an instruction, and the prefix “meta” has no real meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this, this book favors a principle that <strong>metadata is by definition non-runtime.</strong> It is documentation, usually represented as structured or semi-structured data, but not usually a primary processing input or output. It might be “digital exhaust” - log files are a form of metadata. It is not executable. If it’s  executable (directly or indirectly), it’s digital logic or configuration, plain and simple.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what about our infrastructure as code example? The artifact - the configuration file, the script - is NOT metadata, because it is executable. But the source repository commit IS metadata. It has no meaning for the script. The dependency is one way - without the artifact, the commit ID is meaningless, but the artifact is completely ignorant of the commit. The commit may become an essential data point for human beings trying to make sense of the state of a resource defined by that artifact. However, the version control system &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>doesn’t care why files are changing. That is, the content of the changes doesn’t matter. As the developer, you might move a function from here to there and expect this to be handled as one unitary move. But you could, alternatively, commit the removal and then later commit the addition. Git doesn’t care. It has nothing to do with the semantics of what is in the files</em> <a href="#Loeliger2009">[Loeliger2009]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>In this microcosm, we see the origins of IT management.</strong>
It is not always easy to apply this approach in practice. There can be edge cases. Documentation stored in version control needs to be seen as "executable" in the context of the business process. But it too does not require or "know about" the comit. Ultimately <strong>the concept of metadata provides a basis for distinguishing the <em>management</em> of information technology from the actual <em>practice</em> of information technology.</strong></p>

<h4 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Books and articles are written every week about some aspect of IT infrastructure. We have only scratched the surface in our discussions of compute, network, and storage, and how they have become utility services in the guise of Cloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service - each represents a different approach. For the most part, we will focus on Infrastructure as a Service in the remainder of this book, on the assumption that your digital product is unique enough to need the broad freedom this provides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT infrastructure is a rich and complex topic, and a person can spend their career specializing in it. For this class, we always want to keep chapter 1 in mind: why do we want it? How does it provide for our needs, contribute to our enjoyment?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are numerous sources available to you to learn Linux scripting, policy-based configuration management of infrastructure, and source control. Competency with source control is essential to your career and you should devote some serious time to it. You can find many references to source control on the Internet and in books such as <em>Pro Git</em> by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub <a href="#Chacon2009">[Chacon2009]</a>. As it is the most important foundational technology for professional IT, whether in a garage or in the largest corporations, you need to have a deep familiarity with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss further infrastructure issues in Chapter 6, including designing systems for failure and availability.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have some idea of IT value (and how we might turn it into a product), and have decided on some infrastructure, we can start building.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems that directly create value for non-technical users are usually called "applications," or sometimes "services." As discussed in chapter 1, they enable value experiences in areas as diverse as consumer banking, entertainment and hospitality, and personal transportation. In fact it is difficult to think of any aspect of modern life untouched by applications. (This overall trend is sometimes called digital transformation.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications are built from software, the development of which is a core concern for any IT-centric product strategy. Software development is a well established career, and a fast-moving field with new technologies, frameworks, and schools of thought emerging weekly, it seems. This chapter will cover applications and the software lifecycle, from requirements through construction, testing, building, and deployment into modern production environments. It also discusses earlier approaches to software development, the rise of the Agile movement, and its current manifestation in the practice of DevOps.</p>

<p>In keeping with our commitment to theory and first principles, we use an engineering definition of "application."

<p>Without applications, computers would be merely a curiousity. Computers were first "applied" to military needs for codebreaking and artillery calculations. After World War II, ex-military officers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Berkeley">Edmund Berkeley</a> at Prudential realized their potential if "applied" to problems like insurance record keeping. <a href="#Akera2007">[Akera2007]</a> At first, such systems required actual manual configuration (as in the ENIAC photo in this section), or painstaking programming in complex, tedious, and unforgiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language">low-level programming languages</a>. As the value of computers became obvious, investment was made in making programming easier through more powerful languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_software">history of software</a> is well documented. Low level languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">binary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembler</a>) were increasingly replaced by higher level languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTAN</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>). Proprietary machine/language combinations were replaced by open standards and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilers</a> that could take one kind of source code and build it for different hardware platforms. Many languages followed, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual Basic</a>, and <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</a>.

<h5 id="_applications_and_infrastructure_the_old_way">Applications and infrastructure: the old way</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first decades of computing, any significant application of computing power to a new problem typically required its own <a href="#what-is-IT-infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, often designed specifically for the problem. While awareness existed that computers in theory could be "general purpose," in practice this was not so easy. Military/aerospace needs differed from corporate information systems, which differed from scientific and technical uses. And major new applications required new compute capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take for example when a corporation in 1998 decided to replace its mainframe Human Resources system due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K concerns</a>. Such a system might need to support several thousand users around the world. At that time, PeopleSoft was a frequent choice of software. Implementing such a system was often led by consulting firms such as Deloitte or Andersen Consulting (where the author worked). A typical PeopleSoft package implementation would include:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The software and hardware needed to be specified in keeping with requirements, and acquiring it took lengthy negotiations and logistics and installation processes. Such a project from inception to production might take 9 months (on the short side) to 18 or more months.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hardware was dedicated and rarely re-used. The HP servers compatible with PeopleSoft might have few other applications, if they became surplus. In fact, PeopleSoft would "certify" the infrastructure for compatibility. Upgrading the software might require also upgrading the hardware. In essence, this sort of effort had a strong component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">systems engineering</a>, as designing and optimizing the hardware component was a significant portion of the work.</p>

<p>Today, matters are quite different, and yet echoes of the older model persist. As mentioned, ANY  compute workloads are going to incur economic cost. However, capacity is being used more efficiently and can be provisioned on demand. Currently, it is a significant application indeed that merits its own systems engineering.</p>

<p>Instead, a variety of mechanisms (as covered in the previous chapter&#8217;s <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_from_physical_compute_to_cloud">discussion of Cloud systems</a>) enable the sharing of compute capacity, the raw material of application development. The fungibility and agility of these mechanisms increase the velocity of creation and evolution of application software. For small and medium sized applications, the overwhelming trend is to <a href="#virtualization">virtualize</a>
 and run on  commodity hardware and operating systems. Even 15 years ago, non-trivial web sites with database integration would be hosted by internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> clusters at major enterprises (for example, Microsoft ASP, COM+, and SQL Server clusters could be managed as multi-tenant&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the author wrote systems on such a platform).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general purpose capabilities of virtualized public and private Cloud today are robust. Assuming the organization has the financial capability to purchase computing capacity in anticipation of use, it can be instantly available when the need surfaces. Hardware engineering is more and more independent of the application lifecycle; the trend is towards providing compute as a service, carefully specified in terms of performance, but NOT particular hardware. Hardware physically dedicated to a single application is rarer, and even the largest engineered systems are more standardized so that they may one day benefit from Cloud approaches.  Application architectures have also become much more powerful. Interfaces (interaction points for applications to exchange information with each other, generally in an automated way) are increasingly standardized. Applications are designed to scale dynamically with workload and are more stable and reliable than in years past.</p>

<h4 id="_from_waterfall_to_agile">From waterfall to Agile</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a book on software development per se, nor on Agile development. There are hundreds of books available on those topics. But, no assumption is made that the reader has any familiarity with these topics, so some basic history is called for. (If you have taken an introductory course in software engineering, this will likely be review.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the author first joined Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) in 1998, we were schooled in something called the Business Integration Method, or BIM. The BIM was a classic expression of what is called “waterfall development".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is waterfall development? It is a controversial question. The original theorist who coined the term named it in order to critique it <a href="#Royce1970">[Royce1970]</a>. Military contracting and management consultancy practices, however, embraced it, as it provided an illusion of certainty. The fact that computer systems until recently included a substantial component of hardware systems engineering may also have contributed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Waterfall development as a term has become associated with a number of practices. The original illustration was similar to this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.03-waterfall.png" alt="waterfall progression" width="500">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 29. Waterfall lifecycle</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, requirements need to be extensively captured and analyzed before the work of development should commence. So, the project team would develop enormous spreadsheets of requirements, spending weeks on making sure that they represented what “the customer” wanted. The objective was to get the customer’s signature. Any further alterations could be profitably billed as “change requests."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analysis phase was used to develop a more structured understanding of the requirements, e.g. conceptual and logical data models, process models, business rules, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the design phase, the actual technical platforms would be chosen; major subsystems determined with their connection points, initial capacity analysis (<em>volumetrics</em>) translated into system sizing, and so forth. (Perhaps hardware would not be ordered until this point, leading to issues with developers now being “ready”, but hardware not being available for weeks or months yet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only AFTER extensive requirements, analysis, and design would coding take place (implementation). Furthermore, there were separation of duties between developers and testers. Developers would write code and testers would try to break it, filing bug reports that the developers would then need to respond to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another model sometimes encountered at this time was the V-model. This was intended to better represent the various levels of abstraction operating in the systems delivery activity. Requirements operate at various levels, from high level business intent through detailed specifications. It is all too possible that a system is “successfully” implemented at lower levels of specification, but fails to satisfy the original higher level intent.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.03-vmodel.png" alt="1.03 vmodel">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 30. V-model <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_14" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_14" title="View footnote.">14</a>]</sup></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The failures of these approaches at scale are by now well known. Large distributed teams would wrestle with thousands of requirements. The customer would “sign off” on multiple large binders, with widely varying degrees of understanding of what they were agreeing to. Documentation became an end in itself, and yet did not meet its objectives of ensuring continuity if staff turned over. The development team would design and build extensive product implementations without checking the results with customers. They would also defer testing that various component parts would effectively interoperate until the very end of the project, when the time came to assemble the whole system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Failure after failure of this approach is apparent in the historical record (<a href="#Glass1998">[Glass1998]</a>). Recognition of such failures, dating from the 1960s, led to the perception of a “software crisis.”  (It should also be noted that many large systems were effectively constructed and operated during the "waterfall years", and that there are reasonable criticisms of the concept of a “software crisis” <a href="#Bossavit2015">[Bossavit2015]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful development efforts existed back to the earliest days of computing (otherwise, we probably wouldn’t have computers, or at least not so many). Many of these successful efforts used prototypes and other means of building understanding and proving out approaches. But highly publicized failures continued, and a substantial movement against “waterfall” development started to take shape.</p>

<p>By the 1990s, a number of thought leaders in software development had noticed some common themes with what seemed to work and what didn’t. Kent Beck developed a methodology known as “eXtreme Programming,” or XP <a href="#Beck2000">[Beck2000]</a>. XP pioneered the concepts of iterative, fast-cycle development with ongoing stakeholder feedback, coupled with test-driven development, ongoing refactoring, pair programming, and other practices.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Agile models for developing software aligned with the rise of Cloud and Web-scale IT. As new customer-facing sites like Flickr, Amazon, Netflix, Etsy, and Facebook scaled to massive proportions, it become increasingly clear that waterfall approaches were incompatible with their needs. Because these systems were directly user-facing, delivering monetized value in fast-moving competitive marketplaces, they required a degree of responsiveness previously not seen in “back-office” IT or military-aerospace domains (the major forms that large scale system development had taken to date). We will talk more of product-centricity and the overall DevOps movement in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This new world did not think in terms of large requirements specifications. Capturing a requirement, analyzing and designing to it, implementing it, testing that implementation, and deploying the result to the end user for feedback became something that needed to happen at speed, with high repeatability. Requirements "backlogs" were (and are) never "done," and increasingly were the subject of ongoing re-prioritization, without high-overhead project "change" barriers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web-based systems integrate the software development lifecycle tightly with operational concerns. The development of new functionality is moved rapidly into a user-facing state, as opposed to previous models where software development was more distant in time and personnel from operations staff. The sheer size and complexity of these systems required much more incremental and iterative approaches to delivery, as the system could never be taken offline for the "next major release" to be installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software was moving more directly into an operational state, and developers and operators were part of the same economic concern (contract software development never gained favor in the Silicon Valley web-scale community). So, it was possible to start breaking down the walls between “development” and “operations,” and that is just what happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because large scale systems are complex and unpredictable, it is understood that new features are never fully understood until they are deployed at scale to the real end user base. Therefore, large scale web properties also started to “test in production” (more on this in Chapter 6) in the sense that they would deploy new functionality to only some of their users. Rather than trying to increase testing to better understand things before deployment, these new firms accepted a seemingly higher level of risk in exposing new functionality sooner. (Part of their belief is that it actually is lower risk, because the impacts are never fully understood in any event.)</p>

<p>Consider this inquiry by Mary and Tom Poppendieck (<a href="#Poppendieck2007">[Poppendieck2007]</a>, p. 92):</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>How long would it take your organization to deploy a change that involved one single line of code? Do you deploy changes at this pace on a repeat, reliable basis?</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implicit goal is that the organization should be able to change one line of code, and in fact might want to do so on an ongoing basis. There is deep Lean/Agile theory behind this goal, theory developed in reaction to the pattern of massive software failures that characterized IT in the first fifty years of its existence. (We&#8217;ll discuss some of the systems theory, including the concept of feedback, in the introduction to Part II and other aspects of Agile theory, including the ideas of Lean Product Development, in Parts II and III.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Achieving this goal is feasible but requires new approaches. Various practitioners have explored this problem, with great success. Key initial milestones included:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<p>While "DevOps" can be hard to define, the fundamental goal of moving smaller changes more quickly through the pipeline is a common theme. Other guiding principles include, "If it hurts, do it more frequently." (This is in part a response to the poor practice, or <em>antipattern</em>, of deferring integration testing and deployment until those tasks are so big as to be unmanageable.) There is a great deal written on the topic of DevOps currently; the Humble/Farley book is recommended  as an introduction. Let’s go into a little detail on some essential Agile/DevOps practices.</p>

<p>The assumption in this chapter is that you are going to start IMMEDIATELY with a continuous delivery pipeline. <strong>You want to set this up before developing a single line of code.</strong> This is not something to "get around to later." It’s not that difficult (see the online resources for further discussion and pointers to relevant open source projects). What is meant by a continuous delivery pipeline? Here is a simplified, starting overview, based on the <a href="https://github.com/dm-academy/Calavera">Calavera project</a> developed for the IT Delivery course at the University of St. Thomas:</p>

<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>First, some potential for value is identified. It is refined through product management techniques into a feature - some specific set of functionality that when complete will enable the value proposition (i.e. as a <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_it_services_systems_and_applications">moment of truth</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature is expressed as some set of IT work, today usually in small increments lasting between 1 and 4 weeks (this of course varies). Software development commences, e.g. the creation of Java components by developers who first write tests, and then write code that satisfies the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer is continually testing the software as the build progresses, and keeping a local source control repository up to date with their changes at all times. When she or he reaches a level of satisfaction with the software, it is submitted to a centralized source repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the repository detects the new "check-in," it contacts the build choreography manager, which launches a dedicated environment to build and test the new code. The environment is likely configured using <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_infrastructure_as_code">infrastructure as code</a> techniques; in this way, it can be created automatically and quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the code passes all tests, the compiled and built binary executables may then be "checked in" to a package management repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the package repository, the code may then be deployed to various environments, for further testing and ultimately to "production," where it can enable the consumer&#8217;s value experiences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, the production system is monitored for availability and performance.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s go into more detail on the major phases.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_describing_system_intent">Describing system intent</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, you’ve got an idea for a product value experience, and you have tools for creating it and infrastructure for running it. It’s time to start building shippable product. As we will cover in more detail in the next chapter, the product development process starts with a concept of requirements (whether we call it story, use case, or scenario is not important). Requirements are numerous and evolving, and we’re going to take some time looking at the process of converting them into IT-based functionality. There is history here back to the earliest days of computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to design and build a digital product, you need to express what you need the product to do. The conceptual tool used to do this is called Requirement.
The literal word “Requirement” has fallen out of favor with the rise of Agile <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a>, and has a number of synonyms and variations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonfunctional requirement</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Epic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectural epic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectural requirement</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While these may differ in terms of focus and scope, the basic concept is the same - the requirement, however named, expresses some intent or constraint the system must fulfill. This intent calls for work to be performed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Sidebar: The troubled term "requirements"</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In earlier times, the concept of "requirements" was often used as an sort of defense mechanism. Statements would often be heard such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We can&#8217;t start building anything, we don&#8217;t fully understand the requirements"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We can&#8217;t change the requirements now, we&#8217;ve started building! Make up your mind!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The product is a failure because the business kept changing their mind about the requirements."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the term "requirements" is still used throughout much education and training, the student should be aware of this history, and the fact that many Agile practitioners discourage use of the term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Jeff Patton says, "&#8230;&#8203;I learned the word requirements actually means <em>shut up</em>." <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a>, introduction.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User Story Mapping is a well known approach <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a> with origins in the Scrum community. Here is an example from <a href="#Cohn2010">[Cohn2010]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"As a shopper, I can select how I want items shipped based on the actual costs of shipping to my address so that I can make the best decision."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic format is,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a &lt; type of user &gt;, I want &lt; goal &gt;, so that &lt; some value &gt;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The story concept is flexible, and can be aggregated and decomposed in various ways, as we will discuss in Chapter 4. Our interest here is in the basic stimulus for application development work that it represents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#8217;t need an extensively automated system at this stage to capture requirements, but you need <strong>something</strong>. It could be a spreadsheet, or a shared word processing document, or sticky notes on a whiteboard (we&#8217;ll talk about Kanban in the next section.) The important thing is to start somewhere, with team agreement as to what the approach is, so you can move forward collaboratively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss approaches for "discovering" user stories and product features in Chapter 4, where Product Management is formalized. For now, as an early startup of one or two people, it is sufficient that you have some basic ability to characterize your system intent&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;more formalized techniques come later.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Testing software and systems is a critically important part of digital product development. The earliest concepts of <a href="#1.03.02-Agile-history">waterfall development</a> called for it explicitly, and "software tester" as a role and "software quality assurance" as a practice have long histories. Evolutionary approaches to software have a potential major issue with software testing:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
As a consequence of the introduction of new bugs, program maintenance requires far more system testing per statement written than any other programming. Theoretically, after each fix one must run the entire bank of test cases previously run against the system, to ensure that it has not been damaged in an obscure way.
In practice such regression testing must indeed approximate this theoretical ideal, and it is very costly.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This issue was and is well known to thought leaders in Agile software development. The key response has been the concept of automated testing, so that any change in the software can be immediately validated before more development along those lines continues. One pioneering tool was JUnit:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<em>The reason JUnit is important . . . is that the presence of this tiny tool has been essential to a fundamental shift for many programmers.

<p>In test-driven development, the idea essence is to write code that tests itself, and in fact to <strong>write the test before writing any code</strong>. This is done through the creation of test harnesses and the tight association of tests with requirements. The logical culmination of test-driven development was expressed by Kent Beck in <em>eXtreme Programming</em>: write the test first <a href="#Beck2000">[Beck2000]</a>. Thus:</p>

<blockquote>
Refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which is "too small to be worth doing". However, the cumulative effect of each of these transformations is quite significant. By doing them in small steps you reduce the risk of introducing errors. You also avoid having the system broken while you are carrying out the restructuring - which allows you to gradually refactor a system over an extended period of time.

Approaches which encourage ongoing development and evolution are increasingly recognized as less risky, since systems do not respond well to big "batches" of change. An important concept is that of "continuous integration,” popularized by Paul Duvall in his book of the same name <a href="#Duvall2007">[Duvall2007]</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to understand why continuous integration is important, it is necessary to further discuss the concept of source control and how it is employed in real world settings. Imagine Mary have been working for some time with her partner Aparna in their startup (or on a small team) and they have three code modules. Mary is writing the web front end (file A), Aparna is writing the administrative tools and reporting (file C), and they both partner on the data access layer (file B). The conflict of course arises on the file B that they both need to work on.  A and C are mostly independent of each other, but changes to any part of B can have an impact on both their modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If changes are frequently needed to B, and yet they cannot split it into logically separate modules, they have a problem; they cannot both work on the same file at the same time. They are each concerned that the other does not introduce changes into B that “break” the code in their own modules A and C.</p>

<td class="content">
Breaking a system apart by "layer" (e.g. front end versus data access) does not scale well. Microservices approaches encourage keeping data access and business logic together in functionally cohesive units. More on this in future chapters. But in this example, both developers are on the same small team. It is not always possible (or worth it) to divide work to keep two people from ever needing to change the same thing.

<div class="title">Figure 33. File B being worked on by 2 people</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In smaller environments, or under older practices, perhaps there is no conflict, or perhaps they can agree to take turns. But even if they are taking turns, Mary still needs to test her code in A to make sure it’s not been broken by changes Aparna made in B. And what if they really both need to work on B at the same time?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, because they took this book&#8217;s advice and didn&#8217;t start developing until they had <a href="#version-control">version control</a> in place, each of them works on a "local" copy of the file (see illustration "File B being worked on by 2 people").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That way, they can move ahead on their local workstations. But when the time comes to combine both of your work, they may find themselves in "merge hell." They may have chosen very different approaches to solving the same problem, and code may need massive revision to settle on one code base. For example, in the accompanying illustration, Mary&#8217;s changes to B are represented by triangles and Aparna&#8217;s are represented by circles. They each had a local version on their workstation for far too long, without talking to each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the diagrams, we represent the changes graphically; of course, with real code, the different graphics represent different development approaches each person took. For example, Mary had certain needs for how errors were handled, while Aparna had different needs.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<img src="images/1.03-merge-hell.png" alt="merge hell" width="640">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 34. Merge hell</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the diagram "Merge hell," where triangles and circles overlap, Mary and Aparna painstakingly have to go through and put in a consolidated error handling approach, so that the code supports both of their needs. The problem of course is now there are three ways errors are being handled in the code. This is not good, but they did not have time to go back and fix all the cases. This is a classic example of <a href="#technical-debt-1">technical debt</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose instead that they had been checking in every day. They can identify the first collision quickly, and have a conversation about what the best error handling approach is. This saves them <strong>both</strong> the rework of fixing the collisions, <strong>and</strong> the technical debt they might have otherwise accepted:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 35. Catching errors quickly is valuable</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These problems have driven the evolution of software configuration management for decades. In previous methods, to develop a new release, the code would be copied into a very long-lived "branch" (a version of the code to receive independent enhancement). Ongoing “maintenance” fixes of the existing code base would also continue, and the two code bases would inevitably diverge. Switching over to the “new” code base might mean that once-fixed bugs (bugs that had been addressed by maintenance activities) would show up again, and of course this would not be acceptable. So, when the newer development was complete, it would need to be merged back into the older line of code, and this was rarely if ever easy (again, "merge hell"). In a worst case scenario, the new development might have to be redone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter continuous integration. As presented in <a href="#Duvall2007">[Duvall2007]</a> the key practices (you will notice similarities to the <a href="#pipeline">pipeline discussion</a>) include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developers run private builds including their automated tests before committing to source control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers check in to source control at least daily (hopefully we have been harping on this enough that you are taking it seriously by now).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed version control systems such as git are especially popular, although older centralized products are <a href="http://bitquabit.com/post/unorthodocs-abandon-your-dvcs-and-return-to-sanity/">starting to adopt some of their functionality</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration builds happen several times a day or more on a separate, dedicated machine</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% of tests must pass for each build. Fixing failed builds is the highest priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A package or similar executable artifact is produced for functional testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A defined package repository exists as a definitive location for the build output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These practices are well developed and represent a highly evolved understanding gained through the painful trial and error of many development teams over many years. Rather than locking C so that only one person can work on it at a time, it’s been found that the best approach is to allow developers to actually make multiple copies of such a file or file set and work on them simultaneously. Wait, you say. How can that work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the principle of continuous integration at work. If the developers are continually pulling each other’s work into their own working copies, and continually testing that nothing has broken, then distributed development can take place. So, if you are a developer, the day’s work might be as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8 AM: check out files from master source repository to a local branch on your workstation. Because files are not committed unless they pass all tests, you know that you are checking out clean code. You pull user story (requirement) that you will now develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8:30 AM: You define a test and start developing the code to fulfill it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>10 AM: You are closing in on wrapping up the first requirement. You check the source repository. Your partner has checked in some new code, so you pull it down to your local repository. You run all the automated tests and nothing breaks, so you’re fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>10:30: You complete your first update of the day; it passes all tests on your workstation. You commit it to the master repository. The master repository is continually monitored by the build server, which takes the code you created and deploys it, along with all necessary configurations, to a dedicated build server (which might be just a virtual machine or transient container). All tests pass there (the test you defined as indicating success for the module, as well as a host of older tests that are routinely run whenever the code is updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>11:00: Your partner pulls your changes into their working directory. Unfortunately, some changes you made conflict with some work they are doing. You briefly consult and figure out a mutually acceptable approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Controlling simultaneous changes to a common file is only one benefit of continuous integration. When software is developed by teams, even if each team has its own artifacts, the system often fails to "come together" for higher-order testing to confirm that all the parts are working correctly together. Discrepancies are often found in the interfaces between components; when component A calls component B, it may receive output it did not expect and processing halts. Continuous integration ensures that such issues are caught early.</p>

<h5 id="_build_choreography">Build choreography</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Go back to the <a href="#pipeline">pipeline picture</a> and consider step 4. While we discussed <a href="#version-control">version control</a>, <a href="#package-mgmt">package management</a>, and <a href="#deployment-mgmt">deployment management</a> in Chapter 2, this is our first encounter with build choreography.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>DevOps and continuous delivery call for automating everything that can be automated. This goal led to the creation of build choreography managers such as Hudson, Jenkins, Travis CI, and Bamboo. Build managers may control any or all of the following steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Detecting changes in version control repositories and building software in response</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alternately, building software on a fixed (e.g. nightly) schedule</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compiling source code and linking it to libraries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Executing automated tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining compiled artifacts with other resources into installable packages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registering new and updated packages in the package management repository, for deployment into downstream environments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In some cases, driving deployment into downstream environments, including production. (This can be done directly by the build manager, or through the build manager sending a message to a <a href="#deployment-mgmt">deployment management</a> tool.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Build managers play a critical, central role in the modern, automated pipeline and will likely be a center of attention for the new digital professional in their career.</p>

<h4 id="_continuous_deployment">Continuous deployment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once software is compiled and built, the executable files that can be installed and run operationally should be checked into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">Package Manager</a>. At that point, one can take the last mile step and deploy the now tested and built software to pre-production or production environments. The software can undergo user testing, load testing, integration testing, and so forth. Once those tests are passed, it can be deployed to production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(What is “production,” anyway? We’ll talk about environments in Section 2. For now, you just need to know that when an IT-based product is “in production,” that means it is live and available to its intended base of end users or customers.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moving new code into production has always been a risky procedure. Changing a running system always entails some uncertainty. However, the practice of infrastructure as code coupled with increased virtualization has reduced the risk. Often, a rolling release strategy is employed so that code is deployed to small sets of servers while other servers continue to service the load. This requires careful design to allow the new and old code to co-exist at least for a brief time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is important so that the versions of software used in production are well controlled and consistent. The package manager can then be associated with some kind of deploy tool that keeps track of what versions are associated with which infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Timing varies by organization. Some strive for true "continuous deployment," in which the new code flows seamlessly from developer commit through build, test, package and deploy. Others put gates in between the developer and check-in to mainline, or source to build, or package to deploy, so that some human governance remains in the toolchain. We will go into more detail on these topics in chapter 6.</p>

<h3 id="_part_i_conclusion">Part I Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are now at the end of the first section, and one quarter the way through this book (and this course, assuming you are taking a semester long treatment).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are now the proud master or mistress of a functioning startup. You have decided to provide some product that at least partially depends on an IT-based component that you need to actively develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You understand the value that IT brings, and your own product’s needs for it. You have chosen at least a functioning platform for initial development, without falling into the trap of analysis paralysis, although at this point you should be keeping your options open if your initial platform choice doesn’t prove out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you have implemented at least a lightweight continuous delivery pipeline. You didn’t need to spend any money doing this, as so much powerful technology is freely available. In particular, from the start you have taken version control very seriously and have a stable, backed up source repository as a basis for your product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also have at least rudimentary systems for tracking requirements, building your software, storing your packages, and deploying them to your production environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations, you’ve got all the basics in place. Your product is starting to attract sales and/or investors, and you’ve hired a few more people. Let’s talk about collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">

<p><strong>Staying at Level 1</strong>
In your career, many - perhaps even the majority - of the people you meet and work with will be focused on Level 1 in their thinking and approach. This is a fine thing and to be expected. Level 1 is where the real work is done.</p>

<h3 id="_part_ii_introduction">Part II introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>
You are part of a tight-knit team. You’ve moved out of the garage into a more professionalized environment. You might not all be in the same room, but you have a single mission and a cohesive culture, and you don’t need a lot of overhead to get the job done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your startup has met with some success and you are now a team - still small enough to be fed by two pizzas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if people aren&#8217;t that hungry. Even with a few new people comes the need to more clearly establish your product direction, so people are building the right thing. You&#8217;re all in the same location, and can still communicate informally, but there is enough going on that you need a more organized approach to getting work done. Finally, this great thing you&#8217;re building doesn&#8217;t mean much if people cannot understand how best to use it, or if it&#8217;s not running and right people can&#8217;t get to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, things are getting larger and more complex. You have a significant user base, and your founder is increasingly out meeting with users, customers and investors; she isn’t in the room with the product team as much any more… in fact, she just named someone to be “product owner” and what is that all about?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember in Chapter 1 we talked of the user&#8217;s <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/images/1.01-ITStack2.png">value experience</a>, and also how services <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_the_it_service_lifecycle">evolve over time in a lifecycle</a>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two primary value experiences:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The value the user derives from the service (e.g. account lookups, or a flawless navigational experience)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value the investor derives from monetizing the product, or comparable incentives (e.g. nonprofit missions)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the product team derives career value. This becomes more of a factor later in the game. We will discuss this further in chapter 7 on organization, and Part IV on architecture lifecycles &amp; technical debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The product team receives feedback from both value experiences. The day to day interactions with the service (e.g. help desk and operations) are understood, and (typically on a more intermittent basis) the portfolio investor also feeds back the information to the product team (the boss&#8217;s boss comes for a visit).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is of course a simplified model, and in a large enterprise both the users and investors may have proxies (more on this to come).</p>

<p>The practices and approaches established at the team level are critical to the higher levels of scale discussed in Sections 3 and 4. In this section, we discuss small, cross-functional, outcome-oriented teams. We discuss collaboration and customer intimacy, and the need to limit work in process. And we discuss blameless cultures where people are safe to fail and learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these learnings are not firmly established, the organization may struggle to scale; the need for cross-team coordination can (ironically) destroy the performance of individual teams, if not handled well. Scaling success starts with building a strong team level.</p>

<p>You (as the startup leader) are spending more time with investors and customers, and maintaining alignment around your original product vision is becoming more challenging as you are pulled in various directions. You need some means of keeping the momentum here. And the concept of "product management," you&#8217;re finding, represents a rich set of ideas for managing your team&#8217;s efforts at this stage of the game.</p>

<p>Even with a small team of 5 people (let alone 8 or 9), it&#8217;s too easy for balls to get dropped as work moves between key contributors. You probably don&#8217;t need a complex software-based process management tool yet, but you do need some way of managing work in process. And you start to understand that work takes many forms and exists as a concept at different scales.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Chapter 3, your application developers have been running your systems and even answering the occasional phone call from customers. You&#8217;re big enough that you need a bit more specialization. You&#8217;ve got dedicated support staff answering the phone calls and you are finding that, even if you rotate operational responsibilities across developers, it is still a distinct kind of "interrupt-driven" work that is not compatible with heads-down, focused software development. You&#8217;ve probably seen by now that complex systems are fragile and tend to fail; how you learn (or don&#8217;t) from those failures is a critical question.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the term "information systems (IS)" was widely replaced by "information technology (IT)" in the 1990s, do not be fooled. Enterprise IT is a complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system">sociotechnical system</a>, that delivers the digital services to support a myriad of other complex sociotechnical systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merriam-Webster <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/system">defines a system</a> as "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole". These interactions and relationships quickly take center stage as you move from individual work to team efforts. Consider that while a 2 member team only has 1 relationship to worry about, a 10 member team has 45, and a 100 person team has 4,950!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the Senge quote implies, brute force does not scale well within the context of a system. Systems tend to make their own rules. Within the bounds of the system, actions lead to outcomes, which in turn affect future actions. This <strong>feedback</strong> often becomes amplified and re-amplified through the systems' interactions with itself, until an overload occurs, such as the horrible screeching of a microphone too close to a speaker. In the business world, these feedback loops can manifest themselves in rigid platforms, brittle applications, or even a toxic work culture that sabotages success.</p>

<p>A thorough discussion of systems theory is beyond the scope of this book. However, many of the ideas that follow are informed by it. Obtaining a working knowledge of systems theory will not only enhance your understanding of this book, it can also be an essential tool for managing uncertainty in your future career, teams, and organizations.

<h5 id="_defining_feedback_with_examples">Defining feedback, with examples</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feedback is a loaded term. We hear terms like positive feedback and negative feedback, and associate it quickly with performance coaching and management discipline. That is not the sense of feedback in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition of feedback as used in this book is based on engineering. There is considerable related theory in general engineering and especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a> and the reader is encouraged to investigate some of these foundations if unfamiliar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the classic illustration of a feedback loop:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/feedback.png" alt="feedback">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we can consider “rabbit reproduction” as a process with a positive feedback loop:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rabbits.png" alt="rabbits">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more rabbits, the faster they reproduce, and the more rabbits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a “positive” feedback loop, although Mr. MacGregor the local gardener may not agree, given that they are eating all his cabbages!! This is why feedback experts (e.g. <a href="#Sterman2000">[Sterman2000]</a>) prefer to call this “reinforcing” feedback, because there is not necessarily anything “positive” about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can also consider feedback as the relationship between TWO processes:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/processAB.png" alt="processAB">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our rabbit example, what if Process B is fox reproduction, that is, the birth rate of foxes (who eat rabbits)?</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rabbitfox.png" alt="rabbitfox">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More rabbits equals more foxes (notice the “+” symbol on the line), because there are more rabbits to eat! But what does this do to the rabbits? It means LESS rabbits. Which, ultimately, means less foxes… and at some point, the populations balance. This is classic negative feedback. However, the local foxes don’t see it as negative (nor do the local gardeners!)  That is why feedback experts prefer to call this “balancing” feedback.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an engineering sense, positive feedback is often dangerous and a topic of concern. The classic example of bad positive feedback in engineering is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, "Galloping Gertie."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with bridges, at a technical level, reinforcing feedback can be a very bad thing in IT systems. In general, any process that is self-amplified without any balancing feedback will eventually consume all available resources, just like rabbits will eat all the food available to them. So, if you create a process (e.g. write and run a computer program) that recursively spawns itself, it will sooner or later crash the computer as it devours memory and CPU. See <a href="http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/HANDBOOK/runaway_proc.html">Runaway processes.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Balancing feedback, on the other hand, is critical to make sure you are “staying on track.” Engineers use concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping">damping</a>, to keep bridges from falling down. Balancing feedback in a business and IT context takes a wide variety of forms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The product owner clarifying for developers the precise user experience vision for the product, based on a demonstration of developer work in process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end users calling to tell you the “system is slow” (or down)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The product owner or portfolio sponsor calling to tell you they are not satisfied with the system’s value</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, we see these two basic kinds of feedback:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Positive/Reinforcing, “do more of that”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative/Balancing, “stop doing that,” “fix that”</p>

Still confused? Think about the last time you saw a "reply-all" email storm. The first accidental mass send generates feedback (emails saying "take me off this list"), which generate more emails ("stop emailing the list") and so on. This does not continue indefinitely; management intervention, common sense and fatigue eventually damp the storm down.

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>Open loop systems have no regulation, no balancing feedback</p>

<li>
<p>Closed loop systems have some form of balancing feedback</p>

<p>In navigation terminology, the open-loop attempt to stick to a course without external information (e.g. navigating in the fog, without radar or communications) is known as " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead reckoning</a>," in part because it can easily get you dead!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good example of an open loop system is the children’s game “pin the tail on the donkey.” In “pin the tail on the donkey,” a person has to execute a process (pinning a paper or cloth "tail" onto a poster of a donkey - no live donkeys are involved!) while blindfolded, based on their memory of their location (and perhaps after being deliberately disoriented by spinning in circles).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since they are blindfolded, they have to move across the room and pin the tail without the ongoing corrective feedback of their eyes. (Perhaps they are getting feedback from their friends, but perhaps their friends are not reliable….)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without the blindfold, it would be a closed loop system. The person would rise from their chair and, through the ongoing feedback of their eyes to their central nervous system, would move towards the donkey and pin the tail in the correct location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may seem obvious, but the history of IT management (some would say all management) over the past decades has been the struggle to overcome open-loop practices. Reliance on open-loop practices is arguably an indication of a dysfunctional command and control culture. A IT team that is designing and delivering without sufficient corrective feedback from its stakeholders is an ineffective, open-loop system. <a href="#Kennaley2010">[Kennaley2010]</a> applies these principles to software development in much greater depth, and is recommended.</p>

<p>Product strategy was largely tacit in Part I. As the founder, you used product management and discovery practices, and may well be familiar with the ideas here, but the assumption is that you did not explicitly <strong>formalize</strong> your approach to them.

<p>Before work, before operations, there must be a vision of product. You already established a preliminary vision in Chapter 1, but now as your organization grows, you need to consider further how you will sustain that vision and establish an ongoing capability for realizing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many other topics in this book, product management is a significant field in and of itself. Historically, product management has <strong>not</strong> been a major theme in enterprise IT management. Digital changes this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems started by serving narrow purposes, often “back office” functions such as accounting or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_requirements_planning">materials planning</a>. Mostly, such systems were managed as projects assembled on a temporary basis, resulting in the creation of a system to be “thrown over the wall” to operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management, on the other hand, is concerned with the entire lifecycle. The product manager cares about the vision, its execution, the market reaction to the vision (even if an internal market), the health, care and feeding of the product, and the product’s eventual sunset or replacement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the enterprise IT world, "third party" vendors (e.g. IBM) providing the back office systems had product management approaches, but these were <strong>external</strong> to the IT operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nor were IT-based product companies as numerous forty years ago as they are today; as noted in chapter 1, the digital component of modern products <a href="#digital-transformation">continues to increase</a> to the point where it&#8217;s often not clear whether a product is "IT" or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reacting to market feedback and adapting product direction is an essential role of the product owner. In the older model, feedback was often unwelcome, as the project manager typically was committed to the <a href="#2.00.1-open-loop">open-loop dead reckoning</a> of the project plan and changing scope or direction was seen as a failure, more often than not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, it’s accepted that systems evolve, perhaps in unexpected directions. Rapidly testing, failing fast, learning, and pivoting direction are all part of the lexicon, at least for market-facing IT-based products. And even back-office IT systems with better understood scope are being managed more as systems (or products) with lifecycles, as opposed to transient projects. (See the <a href="#amazon-productization">Amazon discussion</a>, below.)</p>

<h5 id="_defining_product_management">Defining Product Management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to define product management, we first need to define product. In Chapter 1, we established that products are goods, services, or some combination, with some feature that provides value for some consumer. BusinessDictionary.com <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product.html">defines it thus</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
[A Product is] A good, idea, method, information, object or service created as a result of a process and serves a need or satisfies a want. It has a combination of tangible and intangible attributes (benefits, features, functions, uses) that a seller offers a buyer for purchase. For example a seller of a toothbrush not only offers the physical product but also the idea that the consumer will be improving the health of their teeth . . . A good or service [must] closely meet the requirements of a particular market and yield enough profit to justify its continued existence.

<p>Product <em>management</em>, according to the <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-management.html#ixzz3bHCVkoWj">same source</a>, is</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
The organizational structure within a business that manages the development, marketing and sale of a product or set of products throughout the product life cycle. It encompasses the broad set of activities required to get the product to market and to support it thereafter.

<p>Product management in the general sense often reports to the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). It represents the fundamental strategy of the firm, in terms of its value proposition and viability. The product needs to reflect the enterprise’s strategy for creating and maintaining customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product strategy for <strong>internally-facing</strong> products is usually <strong>not</strong> defined by the enterprise CMO. If it is a back-office product, then “business within a business” thinking may be appropriate. (Even the payroll system run by IT for HR is a “product,” in this view.) In such cases, there still is a need for someone to function as an "internal CMO" to the external "customers."</p>

<p>Amazon (the online bookseller) is an important influence in the modern trend towards product-centric IT management. First, the founder Jeff Bezos mandated that all software development should be <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">service-oriented</a>, and assume that the functionality being built might at some point be offered to external customers.</p>

<p>Second, a widely reported practice at Amazon.com is the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3037542/productivity-hack-of-the-week-the-two-pizza-approach-to-productive-teamwork">limitation of product teams to between 5-7 people</a>, the number that can be fed by “two pizzas” (depending on how hungry they are).</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://blog.idonethis.com/two-pizza-team/">good reasons</a> for this approach. It has long been recognized in software and IT management that larger teams do not necessarily result in higher productivity.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reasons for this phenomenon have been studied and analyzed (see e.g. <a href="#Madachy2008">[Madachy2008]</a>) but in general it is due to the increased communication overhead of expanded teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product design work (of which software development is one form) is creative and highly dependent on tacit knowledge, interpersonal interactions, organizational culture, and other “soft” factors. Products, especially those with a significant IT component, can  be understood as socio-technical systems, often complex. This means that small changes to their components or interactions can have major effects on their overall behavior and value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This in turn means that newcomers to a product development organization can have a profound impact on the product. Getting them “up to speed” with the culture, mental models, and tacit assumptions of the existing team can be challenging and rarely is simple. And the bigger the team, the bigger the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The net result of these two practices at Amazon (and now <a href="#fowler-quote">General Electric and many other companies</a>) is the creation of multiple nimble services that are decoupled from each other, constructed and supported by teams appropriately sized for optimal high-value interactions.</p>

<p>Face to face interactions, usually enabled by giving the team its own space, are seen as essential for collaboration.

</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dedicated, cross-functional teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outcome (not deliverable/output) focus</p>

<li>
<p>Avoiding toxic individuals (so-called "rockstars, gurus, and ninjas")</p>

<li>
<p>Permission to fail</p>

<p>(Other Lean UX principles such as small batch sizes and visualizing work will be discussed elsewhere; there is significant overlap between Lean UX and other schools of thought covered in this book.)</p>

<p>Lean UX is an influential work among digital firms and summarizes modern development practices well, especially for small, team-based organizations with minimal external dependencies.

"Prescriptive" means detailed and precise. A doctor&#8217;s prescription is specific as to what medicine to take, how much, and when. A prescriptive method is similarly specific. "Agile software development" is not prescriptive; as currently published by the Agile Alliance, it is a collection of principles and ideas you may or may not use.<br>

By comparison, Scrum is prescriptive; it states roles and activities specifically and trainers and practitioners in general seek to follow the method completely and accurately.

<p>Scrum is appropriate to this chapter, as it is product-focused. It calls for the roles of:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>and avoids further elaboration of roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum product owner is responsible for holding the product vision and seeing that the team executes the highest value work. To do this, the potential features for the product are maintained in a "backlog" that can be re-prioritized as necessary (rather than a large, fixed-scope project). The product owner also defines acceptance criteria for the backlog items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master, on the other hand, acts as a team coach, "guiding the team to ever-higher levels of cohesiveness, self-organization, and performance." <a href="#Sims2012">[Sims2012]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum uses specific practices and artifacts such as sprints, standups, reviews, the above-mentioned concept of backlog, burndown charts, and so forth. We will discuss some of these further in Chapter 5 (Work Management) along with Kanban, another popular approach for executing work.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Potentially shippable product increment is an important concept used to decouple the team’s development activity from downstream business planning.

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are seven activities:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The “sprint” is a defined time period, typically two to four weeks, in which the development team executes on an agreed scope</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Sprint Planning is where the scope is agreed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Daily Scrum is traditionally held standing up, to maintain focus and ensure brevity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprint Execution is the development activity within the sprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprint Review is the “public end of the sprint” when the stakeholders are invited to view the completed work</p>

<p>Scrum is well grounded in theory, although Scrum team members do not need to understand the theory to succeed with it. Like Lean UX, Scrum emphasizes high-bandwidth collaboration, dedicated multi-skilled teams, a product focus, and so forth.</p>

<p>The presence of a section entitled "product discovery" in this book is a  departure from other IT management textbooks. "Traditional" models of IT delivery focus on projects and deliverables, concepts we touched on in the  <a href="#2.04.01-process-project-product">last chapter section</a> but that we will not explore in depth until later in the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the idea of "product discovery" <strong>within</strong> the large company is receiving more and more attention. Even large companies <a href="#fowler-quote">benefit</a> when products are developed with tight-knit teams using fast feedback.</p>

<p>For our discussion here, the challenge with the ideas of projects and deliverables is that they represent approaches that are more <a href="#2.00.1-open-loop">open loop</a>, or at least delayed in <a href="#2.00.01-feedback">feedback</a>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Chapter 3, we needed to consider the means for describing  <a href="#system-intent">system intent</a>. Even as a bare-bones startup, some formalization of this starts to emerge, at the very least in the form of test-driven development:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, the assumption in our emergence model is that more formalized product management emerges with the formation of a team. As a team, we now need to expand "upstream" of the core delivery pipeline, so that we can collaborate and discover more effectively. Notice the grey box in the following:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important foundation for your newly formalized product discovery capability is that it must be <strong>empirical and hypothesis-driven</strong>. Too often, product strategy is based on the HIPPO: The Highest Paid Person&#8217;s Opinion.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with relying on "gut feel" or personal opinions is that people&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;regardless of experience or seniority&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;perform poorly in assessing the likely outcome of their product ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some well known research on this topic was conducted by Microsoft&#8217;s Ronny Kohavi. In this research, Kohavi and team determiend that "only about 1/3 of ideas improve the metrics they were designed to improve." <a href="#Kohavi2009">[Kohavi2009]</a> As background, the same report cites that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>"Netflix considers 90% of what they try to be wrong"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"75 percent of important business decisions and business improvement ideas either have no impact on performance or actually hurt performance" according to Qualpro (a consultancy specializing in controlled experiments)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore critical to establish a strong practice of data-driven experimentation when forming a product team, and avoid any cultural acceptance of "gut feel" or deferring to HIPPOs. This can be a difficult transition for the company founder, who has until now served as the de facto product manager.</p>

<h5 id="_product_discovery_techniques">Product discovery techniques</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a wide variety of techniques and even "schools" of product discovery and design; we will consider a few representatives in this chapter section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, when you first started your journey in Chapter 1, you might also have used some of these techniques. But now that you are a team, you are formalizing and relying on these techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These techniques are not mutually exclusive; they may be complementary.
But at the more detailed, digital product level, how do we develop hypotheses for testing, in terms of our products/services? We briefly mentioned User Story Mapping in our discussion of <a href="#system-intent">system intent.</a> But that is only one of many techniques. Other tools include:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The "Jobs to be Done" framework was created by noted Harvard professor Clayton Christensen, in part as a reaction against conventional <a href="#product-mgmt-v-marketing">marketing</a> techniques that</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>"frame customers by attributes—using age ranges, race, marital status, and other categories that ultimately create products and entire categories too focused on what companies want to sell, rather than on what customers actually need."</em> <a href="#Christensen2015">[Christensen2015]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Some products are better defined by the job they do than the customers they serve," in other words. <a href="#Traynor2016">[Traynor2016]</a> This is in contrast to many kinds of business and requirements analysis that focus on identifying different user personas (e.g. 45-55 married Black woman with children in the house). Jobs to be Done advocates argue that "The job, not the customer, is the fundamental unit of analysis" and that customer "hire" products to do a certain job. <a href="#Christensen2006">[Christensen2006]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To apply the Job to Be done approach, Des Traynor suggests filling in the blanks in the following <a href="#Traynor2016">[Traynor2016]</a> :</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Why do people hire your product?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People hire your product to do the job of --------  every ---------- when ----------. The other applicants for this job are --------, --------, and --------, but your product will always get the job because of --------.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding the alternatives people have is key. It&#8217;s possible that the job can be fulfilled in multiple different ways. For example, people may want certain software run. This job can be undertaken through owning a computer (e.g. having a data center). It can also be managed by hiring someone else&#8217;s computer (e.g. using a Cloud provider). If one is not attentive and creative in thinking about the diverse ways jobs can be done, one is at risk for disruption.</p>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_impact_mapping">Impact mapping</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding the relationship of a given feature or component to business objectives is critical. Too often, technologists (e.g software professionals) are accused of wanting "technology for technology&#8217;s sake."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Showing the "line of sight" from technology to a business objective is therefore critical. Ideally, this starts by identifying the business objective. Gojko Adzic&#8217;s <em>Impact Mapping: Making a big impact with software products and projects</em> <a href="#Adzic2012">[Adzic2012]</a> describes a technique for doing so:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>An impact map is a visualisation of scope and underlying assumptions, created collaboratively by senior technical and business people.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Starting with some general goal or hypothesis (e.g. generated through Lean Startup thinking), one builds a "map" of how the goal can be achieved, or hypothesis can be measured. A simple graphical approach can be used:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<td class="content">
Impact mapping is similar to mind mapping, and some drawing tools such as Microsoft Visio come with "Mind Mapping" templates.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most important part of the impact map is to answer the question "Why are we doing this?" The impact map is intended to help keep the team focused on the most important objectives, and avoid less valuable activities and investments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in the above diagram, we see that a bank may have an overall business goal of customer retention. (It is much more expensive to gain a new customer, than to retain an existing one, and retention is a metric carefully measured and tracked at the highest levels of the business.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Through focus groups and surveys, the bank may determine that staying current with online services is important to retaining customers. Some of these services are accessed by home PCs, but increasingly customers want access via mobile devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These business drivers lead to the decision to invest in online banking applications for both the Apple and Android mobile platforms. This decision in turn will lead to further discovery, analysis, and design of the mobile applications.</p>

<h6 id="_the_business_analysis_body_of_knowledge">The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One well-established method for product discovery is that of business analysis, formalized in the <em>Business Analysis Body of Knowledge</em> (BABOK), from the International Institute of Business Analysis <a href="#IIBA2015">[IIBA2015]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) defines business analysis as (p. 442):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>The practice of enabling change in the context of an enterprise
by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to
stakeholders</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BABOK is centrally concerned with the concept of requirements, and classifies them thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Business requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stakeholder requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solution requirements</p>

<p>non-functional requirements</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition requirements</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BABOK also provides a framework for understanding and managing the work of business analysts; in general it assumes that a BA capability will be established and that maturing such a capability is a desirable thing. This may run counter to the Scrum ideal of cross-functional, multi-skilled teams. Also as noted <a href="#system-intent">above</a>, the term "requirements" has fallen out of favor with some Agile thought leaders.</p>

<p>The above parable is meant to illustrate two very different product development worlds. Some product development is constrained by the overall system it takes place within. Other product development has more freedom to grow in different directions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to "discover" the customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cog represents the world of classic systems engineering&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a larger objective frames the effort, and the component occupies a certain defined place within it. And yet, it may still be challenging to design and build the component, which can be understood as a product in and of itself. Fast feedback is still required for the design and development process, even when the product is only a small component with a very specific set of requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flower represents the market-facing digital product that may "pivot," grow and adapt according to conditions. It also is constrained, by available space and energy, but within certain boundaries has greater adaptability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither is better than the other, but they do require different approaches. In general, we are coming from a world that saw digital systems strictly as cogs, and moving towards a world in which digital systems are more flexible, dynamic, and adaptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, when digital components have very well understood requirements, usually we purchase them from specialist providers (increasingly "as a service"). This results in increasing attention to the "flowers" of digital product design, as acquiring the "cogs" is relatively straightforward (more on this in the chapter 8 section on sourcing.).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design thinking is a recent trend with various definitions, but in general combines a design sensibility with problem solving at significant scale. It usually is understood to include a significant component of systems thinking. As Tom Fisher, author of <em>Designing Our Way to a Better World</em> <a href="#Fisher2016">[Fisher2016]</a>, notes:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work in this area of “design thinking,” which takes the thought process and the methods that have been developed for millennia around the design of physical things — products, buildings, cities — and applies that to the so-called invisible world of design, which is all of the systems and organizations that are designed, but we don’t think of them as being designed. And we’re seeing a lot of these systems not working very well.</em><a href="#Peck2016">[Peck2016]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design thinking is the logical evolution of disciplines such as user interface design, when such designs encounter constraints and issues beyond their usual span of concern. Although it has been influential on Lean UX and related works, it is not an explicitly digital discipline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many design failures in digital product delivery. What is often overlooked is that the entire customer experience of the product is a form of design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider for example Apple Computer. Their products are admired worldwide and cited as examples of "good design." Often, however, this is only understood in terms of the physical product, for example an iPhone or a MacBook Air. But there is more to the experience. Suppose you have technical difficulties with your iPhone, or you just want to get more value out of it. Apple created its popular Genius Bar support service, where you can get support and instruction in using the technology:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the product you are using is no longer just the phone, or computer. <strong>It is the combination of the device PLUS your support experience</strong>. This is essential to understanding the modern practices of design thinking and Lean UX. As Jeff Sussna, author of <em>Designing Delivery</em>, notes, "In order to provide high-quality, digitally infused service, the entire delivery organization must function as an integrated whole." <a href="#Sussna2015">[Sussna2015]</a>, p. 18.</p>

<h6 id="_hypothesis_testing">Hypothesis testing</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of hypothesis testing is key to product discovery and design. The power of scalable Cloud architectures and fast Continuous Delivery pipelines has made it possible to test product hypotheses against real-world customers at scale and in real time. Companies like Netflix and Facebook have pioneered techniques like "canary deployments" and "A/B testing."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In these approaches, two different feature approaches are tried out simultaneously and the business results are measured. For example, are customers more likely to click on a green button or a yellow one? Testing such questions in the era of packaged software would have required lab-based usability engineering approaches, which risked being invalid because of their small sample size. Testing against larger numbers is possible, now that software is increasingly delivered as a service.</p>

As your product evolves, you may see an increasing differentiation of concerns, between features and components.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Features are <strong>what</strong> your product <strong>does</strong>. They are what the customers perceive as valuable. “Scope as viewed by the customer” as <a href="#Kennaley2010">[Kennaley2010]</a> says (p. 169).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Components are <strong>how</strong> your product is <strong>built</strong>, such as database vs. Web components. In other words, they are a form of infrastructure (but infrastructure you may need to build yourself, rather than just spin up in the Cloud).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feature teams are dedicated to a clearly defined functional scope, while component teams are defined by their technology platform. Component teams may become shared services, which need to be carefully understood and managed (more on this in Section 3).</p>

<p>It may be easy to say that features are more important than components, but this can easily be carried too far. Do you want each feature team choosing its own database? Not recommended. Allowing feature teams to define their own technical direction can result in brittle, fragmented architectures, technical debt, and rework.</p>

<p>Product-centric thinking is at the core of delivering digital value. Without a clear understanding of the product and its context, investments of time and resources are at risk.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management requires close collaboration between individuals of different skills. Team structures, practices, and culture are critical factors for success. Establishing an experimental mindset is essential; research shows that product ideas must be validated as expert opinion is of minimal value.</p>

<p>Product discovery and design is a broad field; design thinking is an important influence, as design spans more than just the user interface.</p>

As two more assistants were added, however, coordination problems did arise. One day, Miss Bisque tripped over a pail of glaze and broke five pots; another day, Ms. Raku opened the kiln to find that the hanging planters had all been glazed fuchsia by mistake. At this point, she realized that seven people in a small pottery studio could not coordinate all their work through the simple mechanism of informal communication.

<p>You&#8217;re now a team. You need to get work done. When your startup hired its first employees, and you went from two people to three or four, you almost certainly had to think about this. You are now getting feedback from both your users and product leadership calling for prioritization, the allocation of resources, and the tracking of effort and completion. These are the critical day to day questions for any business larger than a couple of co-founders:</p>

<p>People have different responsibilities and specialties, yet there is a common vision for delivering an IT-based product of some value. How do you keep track of the work? Mostly, you are in the same location, but people sometimes are off-site or keeping different hours. Beyond your product strategy, you have support calls increasingly coming in that result in fixes and new features, and it&#8217;s all getting complicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You already have a product owner. You now institute <a href="#_scrum">Scrum</a> practices of a managed backlog, daily standups and sprints. You may also use Kanban-style task boards or card walls (to be described in this chapter), which are essential for things like support-driven work. The relationship of these to your Scrum practices is a matter of some ongoing debate. You don&#8217;t think you need full-blown project management&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;yet. You also may become aware of the idea of "ticketing," if you have people with previous service desk experience. How this relates to your Scrum/Kanban approach is a question.</p>

Task management is the process of managing a task through its life cycle. It involves planning, testing, tracking and reporting. Task management can help either individuals achieve goals, or groups of individuals collaborate and share knowledge for the accomplishment of collective goals.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The product development process drives a wide variety of work activities. As your product matures, you encounter both routine and non-routine work. Some of the work depends on other work getting done. Sometimes you do not realize this immediately. All of this work needs to be tracked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work management may start with verbal requests, emails, even postal mail. If you ask your colleague to do one thing, and she doesn’t have anything else to do, it’s likely that the two of you will remember. If you ask her to do four things over a few days, you <strong>might</strong> both still remember. But if you are asking for new things every day, it is likely that some things will get missed. You each might start keeping your own “to do” list, and this mechanism can handle a dozen or two dozen tasks. Consider an example of three people, each with their own to do list:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this situation, each person has their own “mental model” of what needs to be done, and their own tracking mechanism. We don’t know how the work is being transmitted: emails, phone calls, hallway conversations (”Say Joe, there is an issue with Customer X’s bill, can you please look into it?”)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what happens when there are three of you? Mary asks Aparna to do something and in order to complete it she needs something from Joe, whom Mary is also asking to complete other tasks. As an organization scales, this can easily lead to confusion and "dropped balls."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point, you need to formalize your model of the work, how it is described, and how it flows. This is such a fundamental problem in human society that many different systems, tools, and processes have been developed over the centuries to address it.
Probably the most important is the shared task reference point. What does this mean? The “task” is made "real" by associating it with a common, agreed-on artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="representation"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a “ticket” may be created, or a "work order". Or a “story,” written down on a sticky note. At our current level of understanding, there is little difference between these concepts. <strong>The important thing they have in common is an independent existence.</strong> That is, Mary, Aparna, and Joe might all change jobs, but the artifact persists independently of them. Notice also that the artifact - the ticket, the post-it note - is <strong>not</strong> the actual task, which is an intangible, consensus concept. It is a <em>representation</em> of this intangible "intent to perform." We will discuss these issues of representation further in Chapter 11.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A complex IT-based system is not needed, if you are all in the same room! (Nor for that matter a complex process framework, such as <a href="#ITIL">ITIL</a> or <a href="#COBIT">COBIT</a>. There is risk in using such frameworks at this stage of evolution - they add too much overhead for your level of growth.) It&#8217;s also still too early for formal project management. The "project team" would be most or all of the organization, so what would be the point? A shared white board in a public location might be all that is needed. This gives the team a “shared mental model” of who is doing what.</p>

<img src="images/2.05-commonList.png" alt="common list" width="500">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 43. Common list</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of the task board above has some issues, however. After the team gets tired of erasing and rewriting the tasks and their current assignments, they might adopt something more like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="card-wall"></a></p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 44. Simple task board</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The board itself might be a white board, or a cork bulletin board with push pins. The notes could be sticky, or index cards. There are automated solutions as well. The tool doesn’t really matter. The important thing is that, at a glance, the entire team can see its flow of work and who is doing what.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is sometimes called a “Kanban board," although David Anderson (originator of the Kanban software method) himself terms the basic technique a "card wall." The board at its most basic is not specific to either methodology. The term "Kanban" itself derives from Lean manufacturing principles; we will cover this in depth in the next section. The basic board is widely used because it is a powerful artifact. Behind its deceptive simplicity is considerable industrial experience and relevant theory from operations management and human factors. However, it has scalability limitations. What if the team is not all in the same room? We will cover this and related issues in Part III.</p>

</ul>
</div>

<p>Kanban is a term originating from Lean and the Toyota Production System. Originally, it signified a “pull” technique in which materials would only be transferred to a given workstation on a definite signal that the workstation required the materials. This was in contrast to “push” approaches where work was allowed to accumulate on the shop floor, on the (now discredited) idea that it was more “efficient” to operate workstations at maximum capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factories operating on a "push" model found themselves with massive amounts of inventory (work in process) in their facilities. This tied up operating capital and resulted in long delays to shipment, because of the queueing issues. Japanese companies did not have the luxury of large amounts of operating capital, so they started experimenting with "single-piece flow." This led to a number of related innovations, such as the ability to re-configure manufacturing machinery much more quickly than U.S. factories were capable of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>David J. Anderson was a product manager at Microsoft who was seeking a more effective approach to managing software development. In consultation with Don Reinertsen (introduced in the <a href="#queuing">previous section</a>) he applied the original concept of Kanban to his software development activities <a href="#Anderson2010">[Anderson2010]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#scrum">Scrum</a> (covered in the previous chapter) is based on a rhythm with its scheduled sprints, for example every two weeks. In contrast, Kanban is a continuous process with no specified rhythm (also known as <em>cadence</em>). Work is “pulled” from backlog into active attention as resources are freed from previous work. This is perhaps the most important aspect of Kanban - the idea that <strong>work is not accepted until there is capacity to perform it.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have a white board covered with sticky notes, but if they are stacked on top of each other with no concern for worker availability, you are not doing Kanban. You are accepting too much work in process and you are likely to encounter a "high-queue state" in which work becomes slower and slower to get done.</p>
</div>

<h5 id="_the_theory_of_constraints">The Theory of Constraints</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eliyahu Moshe Goldratt was an Israeli physicist and management consultant, best known for his pioneering work in management theory, including  <em>The Goal</em>, which is a best-selling business novel frequently assigned in MBA programs. It and Goldratt&#8217;s other novels have had a tremendous effect on industrial theory, and now, digital management. One of the best known stories in <em>The Goal</em> centers around a Boy Scout march. Alex, the protagonist struggling to save his manufacturing plant, takes a troop of Scouts on a ten mile hike. The troop has hikers of various speeds, yet the goal is to arrive simultaneously. As Alex tries to keep the Scouts together, he discovers that the slowest, most overweight scout (Herbie) also has packed an unusually heavy backpack. The contents of Herbie&#8217;s pack are redistributed, speeding up both Herbie and the troop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This story summarizes the Goldratt approach: finding the "constraint" to production (his work as a whole is called the Theory of Constraints). In Goldratt&#8217;s view, a system is only as productive as its constraint. At Alex&#8217;s factory, it&#8217;s found that the "constraint" to the overall productivity issues is the newest computer-controlled machine tool&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one that could (in theory) do the work of several older models but was now jeopardizing the entire plant&#8217;s survival. This novelization parallels in important regards actual Lean case studies on the often-negative impact of such capital-intensive approaches to production.</p>
</div>

<p>There is a tremendous wealth of material available on Lean history and theory, and the IT student is urged to become familiar with it. Often, IT professionals resist drawing lessons from non-IT fields, because of a perception that these other fields (especially manufacturing) are “deterministic” while IT systems development is too “uncertain.” In reality, manufacturing is less deterministic than IT professionals often perceive, while software development is, at its most uncertain, just another form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development">new product development</a>, and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development">research and development</a> and therefore can be managed on that basis. Furthermore, much IT work is not R&amp;D (e.g. infrastructure provisionings), and that kind of work is even more suited for the application of manufacturing insights.</p>

<p>Between 2005 and 2012, I was a lead enterprise architect at Wells Fargo Bank, primarily concerned with IT delivery capabilities such as portfolio and service management. One day around 2007, I arrived at my office to find an envelope from my friend Gene Kim, then CTO of Tripwire. Gene and I had been corresponding for some years on high-performing IT, IT process improvement, and related topics. In the envelope was a copy of a book called <em>The Goal</em>, by Eli Goldratt. I was a little mystified, but after reading the book I began to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gene saw the potential of the Theory of Constraints in understanding certain aspects of information technology management, and used it as a template to write another remarkable and influential book, <em>The Phoenix Project</em> <a href="#Kim2013">[Kim2013]</a>. Rather than a manufacturing plant, the Phoenix Project centers on the struggles of the IT team at a medium-sized automotive parts manufacturer and retailer. From a state of chaos, uncontrolled work in process and resource constraints, the team applies Lean, Agile, and DevOps techniques to great effect. In my view, <em>The Phoenix Project</em> is one of the most important works in the history of IT and digital management, and is also an enjoyable novel. I am honored to have been one of the original reviewers. If you are considering a career in IT or digital, it is essential reading. See especially Chapter 30 for an interesting discussion of manufacturing lessons in an IT context.</p>

Queues matter because they are economically important, they are poorly managed, and they have the potential to be much better managed. Queues profoundly affect the economics of product development. They cause valuable work products to sit idle, waiting to access busy resources. This idle time increases inventory, which is the root cause of many other economic problems&#8230;&#8203;queues hurt cycle time, quality, and efficiency.

<p>Even at this stage of our evolution, with just one co-located collaborative team, it’s important to consider work in progress and how to limit it. One topic we will emphasize throughout the rest of this book is <em>queuing</em>. What is a queue? A queue, intuitively, is a collection of tasks to be done, being serviced by some worker or resource in some sequence.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lean manufacturing has been an important movement throughout the 20th century, and one of its central principles is to limit work in process. Work in process is obvious on a shop floor, because physical raw materials (inventory) are quite visible.</p>
</div>
<div id="wip" class="imageblock" style="float: left">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don Reinertsen, quoted above, developed the insight that product design and development had an <strong>invisible</strong> inventory of "Work in Process" that he called Design in Process (DIP). Just as managing physical work in process on the factory floor is key to a factory&#8217;s success, so correctly understanding and managing design in process is essential to all kinds of research and development organizations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<strong>including digital product development.</strong> In fact, because digital systems are largely invisible even when finished, understanding their work in process is even more challenging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is easy and tempting for a product development team to accumulate excessive amounts of work in process. And, to some degree, having a rich backlog of ideas is an asset. But, just as some inventory (e.g. groceries) is perishable, so are design ideas. They have a limited time in which they might be relevant to a customer or a market. Therefore, accumulating too many of them at any point in time can be wasteful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this have to do with queuing? Design in process is one form of queue seen in the digital organization. Other forms include unplanned work (incidents and defects), implementation work, and many other concepts we&#8217;ll discuss in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of whether it is a "Requirement," a "User Story," an "Epic," "Defect,", "Issue," or "Service Request," you should remember it&#8217;s <strong>all just work.</strong> It needs to be logged, prioritized, assigned, and tracked to completion. Queues are the fundamental concept for doing this, and it&#8217;s critical that digital management specialists understand this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will revisit the topic of queuing in Chapter 9. For now, some rules of thumb:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finish what you start, if you can, before starting anything else. When you work on three things at once, the multi-tasking wastes time and it takes you three times longer to get any one of the things done. (More on <a href="#multi-tasking">multi-tasking</a> in this chapter.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infinitely long to-do lists (backlog) sap motivation. Consider limiting backlog as well as work in process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visibility into work in progress is important for the collective mental model of the team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are deeper philosophical and cultural qualities to Kanban beyond workflow and queuing. Anderson and his colleagues continue to evolve Kanban into a more ambitious framework. Mike Burrows <a href="#Burrows2014">[Burrows2014]</a> identifies the following key principles</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with what you do now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree to pursue evolutionary change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initially, respect current processes, roles, responsibilities, and job titles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage acts of leadership at every level in your organization —from individual contributor to senior management.</p>

<li>
<p>Visualize.</p>

<li>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, do you choose Scrum, Kanban, both, or neither?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can see in comparing Scrum and Kanban that their areas of focus are somewhat different.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scrum is widely adopted in industry and has achieve a level of formalization, which is why Scrum training is widespread and generally consistent in content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanban is seen as more flexible but this comes at a cost of more management overhead. It requires more interpretation to translate to a given organization’s culture and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Scrum author Ken Rubin notes, “Scrum is not well suited to highly interrupt-driven work.” <a href="#Rubin2012">[Rubin2012]</a>. (But if your company is too small, it may be difficult to segregate out interrupt-driven work! We will discuss the issues around interrupt-driven work further in Chapter 6.)</p>

<li>
<p>Finally, hybrids exist (Ladas' “Scrumban,” <a href="#Ladas2009">[Ladas2009]</a>).</p>

<p>Ultimately, instead of talking too much  about "Scrum" or "Kanban," the student is encouraged to look more deeply into their fundamental differences. We will return to this topic in the section on Lean Product Development.</p>

In practice, I have not yet seen an automated system the replicates the simple elegance and flexibility of a manual system.

<p>Why are shared visual representations important? Depending on how you measure, between 40% to as much as 80% of the human cortex is devoted to visual processing.

Visual representations are powerful communication mechanisms, well suited to our cognitive abilities.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why <a href="#card-wall">card walls</a> or Kanban boards located in the same room are so prevalent. They communicate and sustain the shared mental model of a human team. A shared card wall, with its two dimensions and tasks on cards or sticky notes, is more informative than a simple to-do list (e.g.  in a spreadsheet). The cards occupy two dimensional space and are  moved over time to signify activity, both powerful cues to the human visual processing system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, monitoring tools for systems operation make use of various visual clues. Large monitors may be displayed prominently on walls, so that everyone can understand operational status. Human visual orientation is also why Enterprise Architecture persists. People will always draw to communicate. (More on <a href="#arch-visualization">visualization and enterprise architecture </a>in Chapter 12.)</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<em>Andon</em> is a manufacturing term referring to a system to notify management, maintenance, and other workers of a quality or process problem. The centrepiece is a signboard incorporating signal lights to indicate which workstation has the problem. The alert can be activated manually by a worker using a pullcord or button, or may be activated automatically by the production equipment itself. The system may include a means to stop production so the issue can be corrected. Some modern alert systems incorporate audio alarms, text, or other displays.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Andon <em>Cord</em> (not to be confused with Andon in the general sense) is another well known concept in Lean Manufacturing. It originated with Toyota, where line workers were empowered to stop the production line if any defective materials or assemblies were encountered. Instead of attempting to work with the defective input, the entire line would shut down and all concerned would establish what had happened and how to prevent it. The concept of andon cord concisely summarizes the Lean philosophy of employee responsibility for quality at all levels <a href="#Ohno1988">[Ohno1988]</a>. Where Andon is a general term for information radiator, the Andon Cord implies a dramatic reponse to the problems of flow - all progress is stopped, everywhere along the line, and the entire resources of the production line are marshalled to collaboratively solve the issue so that it does not happen again. As Toyota though leader Taiichi Ohno states:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Stopping the machine when there is trouble forces awareness on everyone. When the problem is clearly understood, improvement is possible. Expanding this thought, we establish a rule that even in a manually operated production line, the workers themselves should push the stop button to halt production if any abnormality appears.

<p>Andon and information radiators provide important stimulus for product teams, informing priorities and prompting responses. They do not prescribe what is to be done; they simply indicate operational status that may require attention.</p>

<h5 id="_definition_of_done">Definition of done</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As work flows through the system performing it, understanding its status is key to managing it. One of the most important mechanisms for doing this is to simply define what is meant by “done.” The Agile Alliance <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/definition-of-done.html#sthash.6rSCZMyU.dpuf">states</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“The team agrees on, and displays prominently somewhere in the team room, a list of criteria which must be met before a product increment, often a user story, is considered "done" <a href="#Alliance2016">[Alliance2016]</a>. Failure to meet these criteria at the end of a sprint normally implies that the work should not be counted toward that sprint&#8217;s velocity.” There are various patterns for defining "done," for example, Thoughtworks recommends that the business analyst and developer both must agree that some task is complete (it is not up to just one person). Other companies may require peer code reviews <a href="#Narayam2015a">[Narayam2015a]</a>. The important point is that the team must agree on the criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This idea of defining “done” can be extended by the team to other concepts such as “blocked.” The important thing is that this is all part of the team’s shared mental model, and is best defined by the team and its customers. (However, governance and consistency concerns may arise if teams are too diverse in such definitions.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_time_and_space_shifting">Time and space shifting</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point your team will be faced with the problems of time and/or space shifting. People will be on different schedules, or in different locations, or both. There are two things we know about such working relationships. First, they leads to sub-optimal team communications and performance. Second, they are inevitable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The need for time and space shifting is one of the major drivers for more formalized IT systems. It is difficult to effectively use a physical Kanban board if people aren’t in the office. The outcome of the daily standup needs to be captured for the benefit of those who could not be there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, acceptance of time and space shifting may lead to more of it, even when it is not absolutely required. A constant pressure and questioning is recommended, given the superior bandwidth of face to face communication in the context of team collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But not all work requires the same degree of collaboration. While we are still not ready for full scale process management, at this point in our evolution we likely will encounter increasing needs to track customer or user service interations, which can become quite numerous even for small, single-team organizations. This brings us to the topic of the Help or Service Desk.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_service_desk_and_related_tools">The service desk and related tools</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a digital product starts to gain a user base, and as a company matures and grows, there emerges a need for human to human support. This is typically handled by a help desk or service desk. The Service Desk (aka Help Desk), is the human face of IT when the IT systems are not meeting people&#8217;s expectations. We were first briefly introduced to the concept in our Service Lifecycle:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.01-ITStates.png" alt="1.01 ITStates">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service desk is an interrupt-driven, task-oriented capability. It serves as a first point of contact for IT services that require some human support or intervention. As such its role can become broad, from provisioning access to assisting users in navigation &amp; usage, to serving as an alert channel for outage reporting. The service desk ideally answers each user&#8217;s request immediately, requiring no followup. If followup is required, a "ticket" is "issued."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a “help desk,” it may be focused on end user assistance and reporting Incidents.
As a “service desk,” it may expand its purview to accepting provisioning or other requests of various types (and referring and tracking those requests). Note that in some approaches, Service Request and Incident are considered to be distinct processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term "ticket" dates to paper-based industrial processes, where the "help desk" might actually be a physical desk, where a user seeking services might be issued a paper ticket. Such "tickets" were also used in field services:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="float: right">

<img src="images/2.05-ticket.jpg" alt="old ticket" width="250">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 50. A "ticket" from early industry</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IT-centric domains, tickets are virtual; they are records in databases, not paper. The user is given a ticket "ID" or "number" for tracking (e.g., so they can inquire about the request&#8217;s status.) The ticket may be "routed" to someone to handle, but again in a virtual world what really happens is that the person it&#8217;s routed to is directed to look at the record in the database. (In paper based processes, the ticket might well be moved physically to various parties to perform the needed work.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Service Desk capability needs</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>channels for accepting contacts (e.g. telephone, email, chat),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>staffing appropriate to the volume and nature of those requests,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robust workflow capabilities to track their progress, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>routing and escalation mechanisms, since clarifying the true nature of contacts and getting them serviced by the most appropriate means are nontrivial challenges.</p>

<p>Work management in practice has divided between development and operations practices and tools. However, DevOps and Kanban are forcing a reconsideration and consolidation. Historically, here are some of the major tools and channels through which tasks and work are managed on both sides:</p>

<p>One of the challenges with applying Lean to IT (as noted previously) is that many IT professionals (especially software developers) believe that manufacturing is a "deterministic" field, whose lessons don&#8217;t apply to developing technical products. "Creating software is like creating art, not being on an assembly line," is one line of argument.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The root cause of this debate is the distinction between product development and production. It is true that an industrial production line may be repetitive. But how did the production line come to be?

<p>One dead end that organizations keeps pursuing is the desire to make research and development (R&amp;D) more "predictable"; that is, to reduce variation and predictably create innovations. This never works well; game-changing innovations are usually complex responses to complex market systems dynamics, including customer psychology, current trends, and many other factors. The process of innovating cannot, by its very nature, be made repeatable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IT, simply developing software for a new problem (or even new software for an old problem) is an R&amp;D problem, not a production line problem. It is iterative, uncertain, and risky, just like other forms of product development. That does not mean it is completely un-manageable, or that its creation is a mysterious, artistic process. It is just a more variable process with a higher chance of failure, with a need to incorporate feedback quickly to reduce the risk of open-loop control failure. These ideas are well known to the Agile community and its authors. However, there is one thought leader who stands out in this field: an ex-Naval officer and former nuclear engineer named Donald Reinertsen.</p>

<p>Don Reinertsen is well known for advocating the concept of "Cost of Delay" in understanding product economics. The term is intuitive; it represents the loss one experiences by delaying the delivery of some value. For example, if a delayed product misses a key trade show, and therefore its opportunity to launch against competitors, the cost of delay might be the entire market.</p>

<p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.lean4it.com" class="bare">http://www.lean4it.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s talk mental models. The biggest one we have in IT.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the broad system of IT management, we often hear of three stages, “Plan/Build/Run.” We make plans for a new IT system, we construct it, and we run it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT organizations often structure themselves and communicate to a large degree along these lines. I’ve used them myself in any number of writings. However, I have come to question the usefulness of “Plan-Build-Run” (which I’ll abbreviate PBR) as a mental model for understanding and guiding IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it pervades IT management thinking, and can clearly be seen in the structures of frameworks like ITIL and COBIT, PBR is ill suited for the demands of 21st century IT management. I believe it is fundamentally a statement of waterfall thinking.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR1.jpg" alt="2.05 PBR1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major structures of Plan, Build, Run in my experience are framed as discrete, mutually exclusive states, with interfaces (information exchanges and control signalling) in between them. The model reflects IT&#8217;s history of project-centric management, in which large batches of work are moved across those three phases. Since each large batch is fragile and the state transitions are risky and high ceremony, there is also concern for insulating each batch from outside "interference."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This results in systems being built in isolation from one another and without openness to feedback from later stages or other batches of work. Thus we also lose opportunities to learn from mistakes, leverage shared services and ensure architectural consistency across the IT estate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continuous improvement cannot be an afterthought. Yet when PBR is the fundamental model, continuous improvement activities are run as spreadsheet-driven initiatives, poorly resourced and in constant contention with the "real" work of Plan, Build, Run. (The classic example is the massive spreadsheet of Audit findings which becomes a political football in The Phoenix Project. Note that I advocate for a broad definition of continuous improvement.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d suggest these kinds of approaches are essentially "inspecting quality in" and therefore not what Deming would have wanted. ("We cannot rely on mass inspection to improve quality.")</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, is PBR the reflection of your organization&#8217;s communication structures? Conway&#8217;s Law would suggest that PBR is the reflection of embedded organizational communications structures - dating I would argue from the time of Frederick Taylor and the worst excesses of hierarchical, command and control management philosophy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is probably the most pernicious consequence - specialists in planning, building, and running, all trying to optimize their worlds, with the "planners" at the top, the "builders" in the middle and the "runners" taking orders at the bottom. The trouble is that this idealized hierarchical model is utterly ineffective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It certainly doesn&#8217;t reflect military principles, often caricatured as "command and control" (see Reinertsen&#8217;s discussion of military doctrine on decentralized control in Principles of Product Development Flow). Effective product and software development has also long eschewed it; much evidence demonstrates the futility of relying on "expert" opinion and planning in truly complex domains. (See this excellent discussion from a venture capitalist at Y-Combinator.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concepts like Lean Startup experimentation, generalizing specialists, and empowered 2-pizza product teams do not seem to reflect a PBR model. In an Agile world, the work boundaries blur across these phases. Those who plan, also build and run, and the primary planning of worth is planning the next experiment for testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some will say this is unfair. One hears various responses:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Iterate (with increasing speed), either the whole cycle or subsets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert feedback loops.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>See the stages as overlapping</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR2.jpg" alt="2.05 PBR2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My question is, even with these enhancements, is this mental model the best foundation?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the "fast PBR" response a bit more. Agile and Lean Startup arguably would call for many cycles of PBR, with each cycle constituting a test, or a story, or some other small grained delivery. Increasing the speed of this cycle is a widespread theme in discussions of Agile, DevOps, Continuous Delivery, and the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now if you are going to "spin it faster," a circular illustration would seem more appropriate:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR3.png" alt="2.05 PBR3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what happens when we spin this fast? Remember your elementary physics of color? It all blends together, just as we see boundaries blurring today between Dev and Ops:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR4.png" alt="2.05 PBR4">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And when the phases blur, what emerges? That&#8217;s the question&#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, I should say&#8230;&#8203; IF YOU ARE LUCKY it all blends together. This assumes that you have somehow overcome the transactional overhead with those state transitions, information exchanges, and organizational handoffs, as you attempt to speed them up.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What if a given state change isn&#8217;t needed for a particular cycle? You wind up fighting a system hard-wired to protect the role of each activity (and all their sub-activities). You wind up asking to "tailor" methodologies, to exempt your work from activities that are clearly non-value-add, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Accelerating PBR isn&#8217;t sufficient; it is still a sequential process with discrete steps and implications of information and control flow between each, reinforcing a dysfunctional division of organizational responsibilities. Can you get up to speed if people are trying to "optimize" the "plan," "build," or "run" phase independently? How can you optimize one third of a wheel?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I ask: is PBR how work really gets done? How value gets delivered? If it is how work gets done in your organization, how effective is it? If you are fortunate to be working in an organization using Agile approaches, can you in truth characterize them as simply "fast PBR"? Does this mental model fundamentally inform your daily experience?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think "spin it faster" is an insufficient response. A continuous flow is needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR5.jpg" alt="2.05 PBR5">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the delivery cycle accelerates and the boundaries begin to break down between Plan/Build/Run, what emerges? First, one starts to see that work has common characteristics across Plan, Build, and Run.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We might observe that a common workflow or kanban system can be utilized across planning, building, and running activities. We might also notice that smaller teams require people to cover more responsibilities ("generalizing specialists"), especially when the boundaries between planning, building, and running are blurring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see that distinctions between "incidents," "problems," and "user stories" become increasingly arbitrary when it is the same team that needs to respond to any. Certainly, there are differences between proactive and reactive work, but as forms of demand both compete for the same supply of resources, and when tracked in different systems cause overburden, uncoordinated effort, and bad multi-tasking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also see that continuous improvement activities (which are kind of a middle ground between proactive and reactive) are "just more demand" and also compete for resources with purely proactive and reactive demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we consider all this, the question arises: What, in fact, <strong>is</strong> the IT work, in the general case? The irrevocable meeting of demand with supply, with intent to generate value. Same in IT as in the rest of industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are not novel concepts. Supply and demand stem from fundamental economics and operational management. I also want to add Execution, which is a widely accepted industrial term that covers the ideally optimal translation of supply and demand into value, via detailed resource and capacity management, dispatching, process monitoring, and performance analysis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside:  I am not in favor of naive approaches to equating IT delivery with manufacturing. But, as Eric says in The Phoenix Project,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“You think IT Operations is rocket-science compared to manufacturing. What absolute baloney&#8230;&#8203;From where I’m sitting, the people in this [manufacturing facility] have been far more creative and courageous than anything I’ve seen come from you IT guys so far.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Demand management starts from the premise that regardless of the size of the implied work, all demand on IT resources should be understood in a unified manner (as popularized in the Phoenix Project). From a new mobile device to the day’s incident reports and change requests, to a strategic initiative implying a $10 million projects, it’s all “just demand.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Different techniques come into play depending on planning horizon, value, scope, risk, and other parameters - more on this to come. Some demand signals contain others, or have complex interdependencies - e.g. an Incident that generates a Change, or a Project that contains multiple Service Requests. But if we understand demand as a unified entity we position ourselves to provide much better service to our stakeholders while at the same time giving our IT staff a saner existence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supply represents the fundamentals of “atoms, bits, and cells”: hardware, software, and people, under various ownership and sourcing models (e.g. Cloud). The CIO is responsible for increasingly complex IT sourcing and contract management strategies, and understanding one’s baseline supply is key to evaluating new supplier options for technology products and people with the skills to exploit them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, next generation IT execution management starts with demand and supply generally, and looks for optimal (or at least satisfactory) means of delivering value. “Projects” and “tickets” are seen as part of a unified management structure, not as the respective domains of "builders" and "runners." The availability of resources is always considered before releasing work, and ongoing scenario-based forecasting is employed to identify emergent constraints. And time tracking is completely transparent, relying on intelligent automation to determine what people have actually been working on. No Friday afternoon time reconstruction!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, Demand - Supply - Execution. Here is a graphical representation emphasizing the continuous nature of this mental model:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-PBR6.jpg" alt="2.05 PBR6">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Well established IT process areas such as project, release, incident, change, and so forth are important and will continue, but I think a DSE approach could counteract the tendency to form functional silos around each&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;or around a particular PBR cycle and its inputs and outputs&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and instead promote a whole-systems approach to IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To summarize Keynes, “even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of the ideas of some long-dead economist.” Basic conceptual structures like plan/build/run and demand/supply/execute have consequences. When widely adopted to the point where they are just “common sense,” they define our social relationships, operational thinking, problem solving, and more. And thus, while we may think that “plan/build/run” is some form of IT natural law, it is a human construct that can be adapted or even discarded if we no longer find it useful. I think it&#8217;s time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, here is my first graphical representation of the Demand/Supply/Execute model for IT service organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-DSE.png" alt="2.05 DSE">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The intent of this model is to provide an alternative to Plan/Build/Run and its sequential, waterfall, and Taylorist connotations. It is also intended to support modern Agile methods and philosophy which emphasize iteration, fast feedback, flow, and especially (per Don Reinertsen) managing queues, limiting Work in Progress and supporting small batch sizes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bottom to top, this diagram tells a story of demand and supply as they progress through increasingly refined understandings to the very specific execution of work and delivery of value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have markets and regulations, which define and constrain the potential demand for an IT-centric product. Markets are met with strategies and product offerings, which lead to programs of work, projects, and platform decisions. These in turn lead to identifying user stories, writing software, configuring platforms, and executing changes, service requests and work tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is NOT a methodology. These constructs can be as light or heavyweight as needed and value scenarios can originate at any point; there is no contradiction with Lean Startup and Agile principles of architectural iterations and minimum viable products. The existence of "Project" as a concept in the model does not mean that all work happens via Projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That finer and finer grained demand stream parallels a finer and finer grained supply stream. Large blocks of capital are translated into strategic technology choices and vendor relationships and investments in skilled people. More detailed budgets and planning culminate ultimately in the availability of people, hardware, and software for given assignments, e.g, an empty slot on a Kanban board.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, the journey can start anywhere, with a large block of traditionally managed programmatic capital or a small round of seed funding translated directly into a two-pizza team with maximum autonomy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately the deployed IT service system is available for fulfilling transactional service demand which can be measured in terms of quality, availability and performance. When demand and supply irrevocably combine, that is my definition of execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I had a number of requirements driving this model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, it needed to be a graphical representation that could not be read as a sequence. That is the flaw of any model which is too easily reduced to a linear format, such as Plan/Build/Run. Circular models are a popular alternative, but repeating a sequence is not enough.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My primary reservation about value networks is their lack of a goal. What is to be done? How do I develop an action plan without some sense of the network’s purpose? (More here.) But the value network critique of naive sequencing is right on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the names “Plan/Build/Run” and “Demand/Supply/Execute” are similar in format, they are very different structurally. It is not usually possible to fully inventory demand and only THEN turn to considerations of supply. Forecasting is inherent in the relationship between the two, which both must operate continuously and simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, if we are trying to shift the IT mental mental models from sequential to network my proposal is that we start with the simplest non-sequential, non-linear concept, a vertex, two simultaneous vectors converging on a point.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-DSE2.jpg" alt="2.05 DSE2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the inverted “V” approximates human legs, it reinforces the feeling of simultaneous action. Both legs must exert effort simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The gap between the legs of the V is filled with the "Fog of Forecasting."</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-DSE3.png" alt="2.05 DSE3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the lower level, larger grained abstractions it is more difficult to understand demand and supply, especially when product development (e.g. novel software engineering) is involved. As demand and supply converge to the point of execution, a finer and finer grained awareness is created of the impending work and whether it is likely to be successful - that is, if demand will effectively and efficiently be paired with supply. (Notice how the fog lifts as you get closer to actual execution.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We only start to really get a feel for how execution is going to work when we get down to team and individual level assignments across all queues and ultimately actual Kanban slots or their equivalent (e.g. assigned and accepted work orders).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Turning to the choices of terms - the words inhabiting each leg (Asset, Release, Strategy, Team, etc):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the nouns are things that may be found in various IT management systems (Incidents, Assets, etc), or at least deliverables &amp; leadership conversations (Strategies, Programs). Roughly speaking, they go from larger grained and more abstract at the bottom, to smaller grained and more specific at the top.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) is included – one thing I appreciated about the Phoenix Project is that GRC is seen itself as a form of demand. Laws, regulations, and risks translate into policies, controls, and ultimately audit findings to be remediated, and all of this is also demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted above, there is still a risk that each leg will receive too sequential a reading. A value scenario can start anywhere. There is NO methodology proposed or assumed.  As  elsewhere, the framework simply represents frequently used IT terms, including some of my explorations of service semantics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This picture is not overly concerned with functional boundaries (legal and/or internal). These can appear in many ways. The primary boundary is between the service act vertex (inside-out) and the service outcome vertex (outside-in). But additional org boundaries might be found between demand side and supply side functions (IT Demand Management vs. Asset Management), and/or between different abstraction levels (Project Management vs. Incident Management).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, this is an IT-centric representation. The framwork might be more broadly applicable to other domains, but I will leave that to others for now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In closing: I think this mental model is a more accurate reflection of IT practice as it is evolving. It avoids sequential, linear and waterfall thinking as well as command and control Taylorism. It accomodates well known ITSM functional concepts, but aligned along a different fundamental structure, a structure better aligned with economic principles.</p>

<p>But consider a day in the life in the modern corporation: dozens or hundreds of cross functional processes that have become a daily barrage of work on the people housed in the functional areas.

<div class="paragraph">

<p>What drives this? The combination of permanent downsizing, continually increasing governance &amp; compliance burdens, and the assumption that the enterprise can always tolerate another process.

<p>This is why kanban is so radical. Within a limited scope, it is starting to challenge the IT management dogma at least.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As your product gains more use, you find that running it inevitably becomes a distinct concern from building it. For all their logic, computers are still surprisingly unreliable. Servers running well tested software that remain "up" for weeks all of a sudden hang and have to be rebooted. Sometimes it&#8217;s clear why (for example, a log filled up that no-one expected) and in other cases there just is no explanation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Engineering and operating complex IT-based distributed systems is a significant engineering challenge. Even with infrastructure as code, it is distinct from software development per se. Questions of scalability, performance, caching, load balancing, and so forth usually become apparent first through feedback from the operations team.</p>

<p>What do we mean by operations? Operations management is a broad topic in management theory, with whole programs dedicated to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We started to run into this in chapter 5, as we examined the topic of “work management” - in traditional operations management, the question of work is primary. However, in IT, “operations” tends to have a more technical meaning, being focused on the immediate questions of systems integrity, availability and performance, and feedback from the user community (i.e., the service or help desk).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operations often can mean, “everything but development” in an IT context. When merged with Development into “DevOps,” one gets IT Product Management with an Agile twist.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following various definitions of “operations” in an IT context. Some are relevant to our “two pizza team” scenario, some might be more applicable to larger environments:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keeping track of an IT product’s availability (is the Web site working?), and troubleshooting if it goes down (e.g. by rebooting it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Answering phone calls from users requiring support. They may be calling because a system or service they need is malfunctioning. They may also be calling because they do not understand how to use the system for the value experience they have been led to expect from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physically traveling to a remote site to evaluate and if necessary update or fix IT hardware and/or software.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performing routine work, such as installing hardware, granting access, or running or testing backups. Such routine work may be scheduled, or it may be on request (e.g. ticketed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring security protocols are followed, e.g. access controls.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As above, the primary thing that operations does NOT do is develop new systems functionality. However, new functionality usually has operational impacts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In manufacturing and other traditional industries, product development was a minority of work, while operations was where the bulk of work happened. However, when an operational task involving information becomes repetitive and risk-free, it can be automated with a computer. This continuous cycle of innovation and commoditization has driven closer and closer ties between “development” and “operations.” It also has driven confusion around exactly what is meant by “operations.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In many organizations, there is an “Infrastructure and Operations” function. Pay close attention to the naming. A matrix may help, because we have two dimensions to consider here.</p>

“Don’t mess with that server! It’s … Production!!!”
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; unknown
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Production” is a term that new IT recruits rapidly learn has forbidding connotations. To be “in production” means that the broader enterprise value stream is directly dependent on that asset. Breakage or mishandling will result in questions and concerns from powerful forces. Be Very Scared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do things get to be “in production”? What do we mean by that?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let’s get back to our fundamental principle that there is an IT system delivering some "moment of truth" to someone. This system can be of any scale, but fundamentally we are able to conceive of it having a “state.” (See http::/url[State, Configuration, and Discovery].)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we want to change the behavior of this system, we are cautious. We reproduce the system at varying levels of fidelity and experiment with potential changes. This is called development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we start to gain confidence in our experiments, we increase the fidelity and also start to communicate more widely that we are contemplating a change to the state of the system. We may increase the fidelity along a set of traditional names: </p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance Testing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final state, where value is realized, is “Production.”</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.06-environments.png" alt="2.06 environments">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is nothing sacred about the environments listed above. You will see many variations, especially at scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea that one sequentially moves (”promotes”) new system functionality through a series of states to gain confidence before finally changing the state of the production system is historically well established. However, the production state is notoriously difficult to reproduce fully, especially in highly distributed environments. While infrastructure as code has simplified the problem, lower environments simply can&#8217;t match production completely in all its complexity, especially interfaced interactions with other systems or when large, expensive pools of capacity are involved.. Therefore there is always risk in changing the state of the production system. Mitigating strategies include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extensive automated test harnesses that can quickly determine if system behavior has been unfavorably altered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Elaborating lower environments with strategies such as service virtualization to make them appear more like production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardening services against their own failure in production, or the failure of services on which they depend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the size (and therefore complexity and risk) of changes to production (a key DevOps strategy).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that changes to the production system can be easily and automatically reversed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using policy-aware infrastructure management tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important development in environmental approaches is A/B testing. In this approach, the “production” environment is segregated into two or more discrete states, with different features or behaviors exposed to users in order to assess their reactions (see sidebar).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_do_we_need_environments_at_all">Do we need environments at all?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The author has heard it recommended that the term “environment” be eliminated, as it tends to result in turf wars and empire building, and potentially the waste of fixed assets (see chapter 8). Performance environments are particularly in question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, in a dynamic infrastructure environment (private or public), one simply defines the kind of test one wants to perform and provisions that capacity on-demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Testing in Production?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It used to be that the concept of “testing in production” was frowned upon. Now, with these mitigating strategies, and the recognition that complex systems cannot ever be fully reproduced, there is more tolerance for the idea.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But with older systems that may lack automated testing, incremental deployment, or easy rollback, it is strongly recommended to retain existing promotion strategies, as these are battle-tested and known to reduce risk. Often, their cycle time can be decreased.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__development_is_production">“Development is production”</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the flip side, development systems must never be treated casually.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The development pipeline itself (Chapter 3, figure X) represents a significant operational commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure of a source code repository, if not backed up, could wipe out a company (see the Code Spaces sidebar in Chapter 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure of a build server or package repository could be almost as bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the digital economy, dozens or hundreds of developers out of work represents a severe operational and financial setback, even if the nominal “production” systems continue to function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s therefore important to treat “development” platforms with the same care as production systems. This requires nuanced approaches: with infrastructure as code, particular virtual machines or containers may represent experiments, expected to fail often and be quickly rebuilt. No need for burdensome change processes when VM base images and containers are being set up and torn down hundreds of times each day!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But the platforms supporting the instantiation and teardown of those VMs are production platforms, supporting the business of new systems development.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But how does one “observe” computing infrastructure? Clearly, sitting in the data center (assuming you could get in) and looking at the faceplates of servers will not convey much useful information. Monitoring tools are the software that watches the software (and systems more broadly).</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variety of techniques are used to monitor computing infrastructure. Typically these involve communication over a network with the device being managed. Often, the network traffic is over the same network carrying the primary traffic of the computers. Sometimes, however, there is a distinct "out of band" network for management traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A classic, simple monitoring tool will simply observe a computing node, perhaps by “pinging” it periodically, and will raise an alert if the node does not respond within an expected time frame. If you are working through this course&#8217;s labs, you will see an example of this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More broadly, these tools provide a variety of mechanisms for monitoring and controlling operational IT systems, often through small software “agents” deployed to computing platforms. These agents may monitor processes and their return codes, performance metrics (e.g. memory and CPU utilization), events raised through various channels, network availability, log file contents (e.g. with standing filters for messages indicating problems), interactions with other elements in the IT infrastructure, and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some monitoring covers low level system indicators not usually of direct interest to the end user. Other monitoring may attempt to synthetically re-create the user&#8217;s "moment of truth." Web application response time monitoring, in which synthetic transactions are run as proxies for end user experience, is an example of this. See <a href="#Limoncelli2014">[Limoncelli2014]</a>, chapters 16-17.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this data may then be forwarded to a central console and be integrated, with the objective of supporting the organization’s service level agreements in priority order.
Enterprise monitoring tools are notorious for requiring agents (small, continuously-running programs) on servers; while some things can be detected without such agents, having software running on a given computer still provides the richest data. Since licensing is often agent-based, this gets expensive.</p>

<h5 id="_aggregation_and_operations_centers">Aggregation and operations centers</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not possible for a Level-1 24 x 7 operations team to access and understand the myriads of element managers and specialized monitoring tools present in the large IT environment. Instead, these teams rely on aggregators of various kinds to provide an integrated view into the complexity. These aggregators may focus on raw status events, or specifically on performance aspects related either to the elements or to logical transactions flowing across them. They may incorporate dependencies from configuration management to provide a true “business view” into the event streams. This is directly analogous to the concept of andon board from Lean practices, or the idea of “information radiator” from Agile principles (<strong>*</strong> cite AA).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A monitoring console may present a rich set of information to an operator. Too rich, in fact, as systems become large. For this reason, monitoring tools are often linked directly to ticketing systems; on certain conditions, a ticket is created and assigned to a team or individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enabling a monitoring console to auto-create tickets however, needs to be carefully considered and designed. A notorious scenario is the “ticket storm,” where a monitoring system creates multiple (perhaps thousands) of tickets, all essentially in response to the same condition. Event de-duplication starts to become an essential capability, which leads to distinguishing the monitoring system from the event management system.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_understanding_business_impact">Understanding business impact</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the intersection of event aggregation and operations centers is the need to understand business impact. It is not, for example, always obvious what a server is being used for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may be surprising to new students, and perhaps those with experience in smaller organizations. However, in many large “traditional” IT environments, where the operations team is distant from the development organization, it is not necessarily easy to determine what a given hardware or software resource is doing or why it is there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearly, this is unacceptable in terms of security, value management, and any number of other concerns. However, from the start of distributed computing, the question “what is on that server?” has been all too frequent in large IT shops.</p>

<p>The above lists are very simple examples of what can be extensive record-keeping. But the key user story is implied: if we can&#8217;t ping SRV0001, we know that the Quadrex application supporting Logistics is at risk, and we should contact Mary Smith ASAP, if she hasn&#8217;t already contacted us. (Sometimes, the user community calls right away; in other cases, they may not, and proactively contacting them is a positive and important step.)</p>

<blockquote>
In computer science and automata theory, the state of a digital logic circuit or computer program is a technical term for all the stored information, at a given instant in time, to which the circuit or program has access.[1] The output of a digital circuit or computer program at any time is completely determined by its current inputs and its state.
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In all of IT (whether “infrastructure” or “applications” there is a particular concern with managing state. IT systems are remarkably fragile. One incorrect bit of information - a “0” instead of a “1” - can completely alter a system’s behavior, to the detriment of business operations depending on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, any development of information technology - starting with the initial definition of the computing platform - depends on robust management of state.
￼
The following are examples of state:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name of a particular server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network address of that server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The software installed on that server, in terms of the exact version and bits that comprise it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>State also has more transient connotations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current processes listed in the process table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The memory allocated to each process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current users logged into the system</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we saw in the previous section some server/application/business mappings. These are also a form of state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore not possible to make blanket statements like “we need to manage state.” Computing devices go through myriads of state changes with every cycle of their internal clock. (Analog and quantum computing are out of scope for this book.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary question in managing state is “what matters”? What aspects of the system need to persist, in a reliable and reproducible manner?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of OODA, determining and tracking the state of a system under investigation is one of the fundamental tools. With current practices, for example, this might mean examining the configuration management/provisioning system to determine how the basic operating system was built.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Three flavors of drift:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p>Drift from standard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drift from baseline</p>

<h5 id="_discovery">Discovery</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Closely related to monitoring is the concept of discovery. While monitoring focuses on the activity of a given system, discovery is focused on state. Answering this question has resulted in a significant market for so-called “discovery” tools, which seek to profile the server and understand its installed software, processing patterns and communications with an objective of assigning it to some management construct, such as a high level IT application or service.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>What is the future of discovery tools?</strong>
There is some evidence that the increasing automation of IT infrastructure will mitigate management and drift problems. As the software pipeline becomes increasingly automated, tracking software from development through production becomes easier.</p>

<div class="content">
<pre>[review ch 2 for overlaps]</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two important concepts have emerged in the past decade: policy-based management and promise theory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In brief, policy-based management and promise theory focus on “what,” not “how.” This may also be described as “declarative,” not “imperative” (see Sidebar).</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>A simple example of “declarative” vs “imperative”</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Declarative: “Get me a gallon of milk.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imperative: “Go out the door, take a right, take a left, go into the building with a big ‘SA’ on it, go in to the last aisle, take a left, go to the third case and take the first container on the fourth shelf from the bottom. Give money to the cashier and bring the container back home.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In configuring infrastructure, scripting is in general considered “imperative” while advanced infrastructure automation frameworks are built using a “declarative,” policy-based approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>For example, the following shell script and Chef recipe do the same thing:
create example - can’t find anything decent on web
Use directory creation example with failure of script b/c not idempotent</pre>

<h4 id="_capacity_and_performance_management">Capacity and performance management</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Capacity and performance management are closely related, but not identical terms encountered as IT systems scale up and encounter significant load.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A capacity management system may include large quantities of data harvested from monitoring and event management systems, stored for long periods of time so that history of system utilization is understood and some degree of prediction can be ventured for upcoming utilization.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The classic example of significant capacity utilization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)">Black Friday/Cyber Monday</a> experience of retailers. Both physical store and online ecommerce systems are placed under great strain annually around this time, with the year&#8217;s profits potentially on the line.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_performance_management">Performance management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance management focuses on the responsiveness (e.g. speed) of the systems being used. Responsiveness may be related to capacity utilization, but some capacity issues don&#8217;t immediately affect responsiveness. For example, a disk drive may be approaching full. When it fills, the system will immediately crash, and performance is severely affected. But until then, the system performs fine. The disk needs to be replaced on the basis of capacity reporting, not performance trending. On the other hand, some performance issues are not related to capacity. A mis-configured router might badly affect a web site&#8217;s performance, but the configuration simply needs to be fixed - there is no need to handle as a capacity-related issue.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_analytics">Analytics</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Capacity analytics at its most advanced is a true Big Data problem domain. At a simpler level, it may consist of monitoring CPU, memory, and storage utilization across a given set of nodes, and raising alerts if certain threshholds are approached.</p>
