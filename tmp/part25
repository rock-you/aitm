As mentioned in the Part Introduction, you cannot start developing a product until you decide what you will build it with. (You may have a difficult time writing an app for a mobile phone if you choose the COBOL programming language!)  You also need to understand something of how computers are operated, enough so that you can make decisions on how your system will run. Most startups choose to run IT services on infrastructure owned by a Cloud provider, but there are other options. Certainly, as you scale up, you'll need to be more and more sophisticated in your understanding of your underlying IT services.
 
Configuring your base platform is one of the most important capabilities you will need to develop. You'll never stop doing it. The basis of modern configuration management is \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control}{version control}, which we cover here.
 
This is one of the more technical chapters. Supplementary reading may be required for those completely unfamiliar with computing. See \hyperlink{reader-assumptions}{Assumptions of the Reader} for notes on the book's approach.
