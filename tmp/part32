\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{_conclusion}\hyperlabel{_conclusion}%
  
Books and articles are written every week about some aspect of IT infrastructure. We have only scratched the surface in our discussions of compute, network, and storage, and how they have become utility services in the guise of Cloud. Software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service -{} each represents a different approach. For the most part, we will focus on Infrastructure as a Service in the remainder of this book, on the assumption that your digital product is unique enough to need the broad freedom this provides.
 
IT infrastructure is a rich and complex topic, and a person can spend their career specializing in it. For this class, we always want to keep chapter 1 in mind: why do we want it? How does it provide for our needs, contribute to our enjoyment? There are numerous sources available to you to learn Linux scripting, policy-{}based configuration management of infrastructure, and source control. Competency with source control is essential to your career and you should devote some serious time to it. You can find many references to source control on the Internet and in books such as \emph{Pro Git} by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub \hyperlink{Chacon2009}{[Chacon2009]}. As it is the most important foundational technology for professional IT, whether in a garage or in the largest organizations, you need to have a deep familiarity with it.
 
We will discuss further infrastructure issues in Chapter 6, including designing systems for failure and availability.
 
\subsubsection{Discussion questions}
\label{_discussion_questions_2}\hyperlabel{_discussion_questions_2}%
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} Consider your product idea from the previous chapter. Does it have any particular infrastructure needs you can identify, having read this chapter?
 

\item{} Your personal laptop or smart phone is infrastructure. What issues have you had with it? Have you had to change its configuration?
 

\item{} Would you prefer to build your product on an IaaS or PaaS platform (see \hyperlink{cloud-models}{the Cloud models})? Is there an SaaS product that might serve? (If so, what is your value-{}adding idea?)
 

\item{} Compare the costs of Cloud to owning your own server. Assume you buy a server inexpensively on EBay and put it in your garage. What other factors might you consider before doing this?
 
\end{enumerate}
  
\subsubsection{Research \& practice}
\label{_research_practice_2}\hyperlabel{_research_practice_2}%
  \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} Research Cloud providers and recommend which you would prefer to build your new product on.
 

\item{} Interview someone who has worked in a data center as to what a "day in the life" is, and how it's changed for them.
 

\item{} Install Vagrant and Virtualbox on your personal device and bring up a Linux virtual machine. Run a Linux tutorial.
 

\item{} Configure a declarative infrastructure manager (Chef, Puppet, Ansible, or Salt Stack) to control your Vagrant VMs. Use git to control your configurations.
 

\item{} Install Docker and run a tutorial on it.
 
\end{enumerate}
