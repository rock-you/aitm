\textbf{Instructor's note}


I have opted to defer the "theory" of Agile to Parts II and III. So, this chapter presents Agile and related concepts like iterative development without examining the underlying principles.

I do this because I have discovered that theory sometimes works better in retrospect. Many students increasingly come in with some exposure to Cloud and Agile methods at least, and Chapters 2 and 3 will seem comfortable and familiar. In Chapters 4 and on we challenge them with \textbf{why} Agile works.
