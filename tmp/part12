Here is a conceptual illustration of an IT management progression (read bottom to top):

Elaborating the above outline into chapters, we have:
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]

\item{} \textbf{Founder}
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} \textbf{IT value.} Why do we need computers? What can they do for us?
 

\item{} \textbf{IT infrastructure.} We want to build something. We have to choose a platform first.
 

\item{} \textbf{IT applications.} Let's start building something of use to someone.
 
\end{enumerate}
 

\item{} \textbf{Team}
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} \textbf{Product management.} What exactly is it that we are building? What is the process of discovering our customer's needs and quickly testing how to meet them? How do we better define the product vision, and the way of working towards it, for a bigger team?
 

\item{} \textbf{Work management.} How do we keep track of what we are doing and communicate our progress and needs at the simplest level?
 

\item{} \textbf{Operations management.} How do we sustain this surprisingly fragile digital service in its ongoing delivery of value?
 
\end{enumerate}
 
\end{enumerate}
 \begin{DBKadmonition}{warning}{Warning}
 
\textbf{The boundary between the \textquotedblleft{}Team\textquotedblright{} and the \textquotedblleft{}Team of Teams\textquotedblright{} is a challenging area, and industry responses remain incomplete and evolving.}
 \end{DBKadmonition}
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*.]

\item{} \textbf{Team of Teams}
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} \textbf{Coordination.} When we have more than one team, they need to \emph{coordinate}, which we define as "the process of managing dependencies among activities." There are many synchronization techniques to help us coordinate, including project and process management and Agile concepts. What is the future of process management as a delivery model?
 

\item{} \textbf{Planning and investment.} We make investments in various products, programs, and/or projects, and we are now big enough that we have portfolios of them. How do we decide? How do we choose and work with our suppliers? How do we manage the finances of complex digital organizations? What is the future of project management as a delivery model?
 

\item{} \textbf{Organization and culture.} We're getting big. How do we deal with this?  How are we structured, and why that way? How can we benefit from increasing maturity and specialization while still maintaining a responsive digital product? How do we hire great people and get the most out of them? What are the unwritten values and norms in our company and how can we change them?
 
\end{enumerate}
 

\item{} \textbf{Enterprise}
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} \textbf{Governance, risk, security, and compliance.} We need to cope with structural and external forces (investors, directors, regulators, vendor partners, security adversaries, auditors) to whom we are ultimately accountable or who are otherwise defining our options. What are their motivations? How do we understand and control risk? How are we assured that our strategy, tactics, and operations are reasonable, sound, and thorough? And how do we protect ourselves from adversaries?
 

\item{} \textbf{Enterprise information management.} We've been concerned with data, information, and knowledge since the earliest days of our journey. But at this scale, we have to formalize our approaches and understandings; without that, we will never capture the full value available with modern analytics and big data. Compliance issues are also compelling us to formalize here.
 

\item{} \textbf{Architecture and portfolio.} We need to understand the big picture of interacting lifecycles, reduce technical debt and redundancy, accelerate development through establishing platforms, and obtain better economies of scale. We do so in part through applying techniques such as visualization, standardization, and portfolio management. We need to define our investment strategy based on a sound understanding of both business needs and technology limitations.
