\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{_conclusion_3}\hyperlabel{_conclusion_3}%
  
As with most other chapters in this book, this brief survey cannot do justice to such a broad field.
 
Product-{}centric thinking is at the core of delivering digital value. Without a clear understanding of the product and its context, investments of time and resources are at risk.
 
Product management requires close collaboration between individuals of different skills. Team structures, practices, and culture are critical factors for success. Establishing an experimental mindset is essential; research shows that product ideas must be validated as expert opinion is of minimal value.
 
Product discovery and design is a broad field; design thinking is an important influence, as design spans more than just the user interface.
 
\subsubsection{Discussion questions}
\label{_discussion_questions_4}\hyperlabel{_discussion_questions_4}%
  \begin{itemize}

\item{} Can you think of examples from your own experience where you or someone else confused "output" (e.g. deliverable) with "outcome"?
 

\item{} What is your experience with being on teams? Have you ever been on a team where people felt the \hyperlink{psych-safety}{psychological safety} to take risks? Or the opposite?
 

\item{} Can you identify two or three distinct features (as defined \hyperlink{feature-v-component}{above}) for a commercial product such as Facebook or Netflix? Try to "reverse engineer" features that might have been individual areas of investment.
 

\item{} Can you think of any components  (as defined \hyperlink{feature-v-component}{above}) you will need?
 
\end{itemize}
  
\subsubsection{Research \& practice}
\label{_research_practice_4}\hyperlabel{_research_practice_4}%
  \begin{itemize}

\item{} If you have team product ideas from previous discussions, consider them in terms of the \hyperlink{vuf}{Cagan/Patton} questions and prepare an analysis:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Is it valuable?
 

\item{} Is it usable?
 

\item{} Is it feasible?
 
\end{itemize}
 

\item{} Identify and analyze a situation where "design" requires a broad, design thinking understanding of both physical product as well as the service interactions surrounding it. Present to your class.
 

\item{} Review the Scaled Agile Framework's descriptions of \href{http://www.scaledagileframework.com/feature/}{features} and \href{http://www.scaledagileframework.com/stories/}{user stories}. Document one feature consisting of several stories for your product.
 

\item{} Research Behavior-{}Driven Development and consider its potential value for you.
 
\end{itemize}
