The Capability Maturity Model was originally published by Watts Humphrey in 1989 in the book \emph{Managing the Software Process} \hyperlink{Humphrey1989}{[Humphrey1989]}. The CMM was later taken on by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie-{}Mellon University, and is now managed by the CMMI Institute, which was acquired in 2016 by  ISACA. The CMM has had considerable influence on software development and IT management more generally. It popularized the idea that process management tends to evolve in the same way across organizations, following a "staged" model:
 
Stage 1: Initial
 
Stage 2: Repeatable
 
Stage 3: Defined
 
Stage 4: Managed
 
Stage 5: Optimizing
 
(These are Humphrey's original levels. There are some differences with the current CMMI, but the concept is the same.)
 
These ideas can be seen reflected in later guidance such as COBIT and ITIL.
 
Within this overall framework of maturation, CMMI currently calls for 22 process areas:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR)
 

\item{} Configuration Management (CM)
 

\item{} Decision Analysis and Resolution (DAR)
 

\item{} Integrated Project Management (IPM)
 

\item{} Measurement and Analysis (MA)
 

\item{} Organizational Process Definition (OPD)
 

\item{} Organizational Process Focus (OPF)
 

\item{} Organizational Performance Management (OPM)
 

\item{} Organizational Process Performance (OPP)
 

\item{} Organizational Training (OT)
 

\item{} Product Integration (PI)
 

\item{} Project Monitoring and Control (PMC)
 

\item{} Project Planning (PP)
 

\item{} Process and Product Quality Assurance (PPQA)
 

\item{} Quantitative Project Management (QPM)
 

\item{} Requirements Development (RD)
 

\item{} Requirements Management (REQM)
 

\item{} Risk Management (RSKM)
 

\item{} Supplier Agreement Management (SAM)
 

\item{} Technical Solution (TS)
 

\item{} Validation (VAL)
 

\item{} Verification (VER)
 
\end{itemize}
 
CMMI for a time was a critical requirement for obtaining US Government contracts, especially from the Department of Defense. As a result, outsourcing firms devoted significant effort and resources to becoming "Level 5" certified.
