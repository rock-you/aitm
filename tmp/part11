\section{Assumptions about the reader}
\label{_assumptions_about_the_reader}\hyperlabel{_assumptions_about_the_reader}%
  \begin{itemize}

\item{} This book is written at the advanced undergraduate/graduate student level. It is currently available only in English.
 

\item{} There is no assumption of deep IT experience, but it is assumed that the person will interact with computers in some capacity and has basic technical literacy. They should, for example, understand the concept of an operating system. An A+ certification, or an intro to programming class for example, would more than adequately prepare someone for this book.
 

\item{} A person completely unfamiliar with computing will need to supplement their reading as suggested throughout the text. There is a wealth of free and accurate information on IT fundamentals (e.g., computing, storage, networking, programming, etc.), and this book seeks more to curate than replicate.
