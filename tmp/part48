\subsection{A brief introduction to feedback}

While the term "information systems (IS)" was widely replaced by "information technology (IT)" in the 1990s, do not be fooled. Enterprise IT is a complex \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system}{sociotechnical system}, that delivers the digital services to support a myriad of other complex sociotechnical systems.
 
Merriam-{}Webster \href{http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/system}{defines a system} as "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole". These interactions and relationships quickly take center stage as you move from individual work to team efforts. Consider that while a 2 member team only has 1 relationship to worry about, a 10 member team has 45, and a 100 person team has 4,950!
 
As the Senge quote implies, brute force does not scale well within the context of a system. Systems tend to make their own rules. Within the bounds of the system, actions lead to outcomes, which in turn affect future actions. This \textbf{feedback} often becomes amplified and re-{}amplified through the systems' interactions with itself, until an overload occurs, such as the horrible screeching of a microphone too close to a speaker. In the business world, these feedback loops can manifest themselves in rigid platforms, brittle applications, or even a toxic work culture that sabotages success.
 
A thorough discussion of systems theory is beyond the scope of this book. However, many of the ideas that follow are informed by it. Obtaining a working knowledge of systems theory will not only enhance your understanding of this book, it can also be an essential tool for managing uncertainty in your future career, teams, and organizations. If you are interested in this topic, you might start with \emph{An Introduction to General Systems Thinking} by Gerald Weinberg \hyperlink{Weinberg2001}{[Weinberg2001]}.
 
Feedback is a loaded term. We hear terms like positive feedback and negative feedback, and associate it quickly with performance coaching and management discipline. That is not the sense of feedback in this book. The definition of feedback as used in this book is based on engineering. There is considerable related theory in general engineering and especially \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory}{control theory} and the reader is encouraged to investigate some of these foundations if unfamiliar.
 
Here is the classic illustration of a reinforcing feedback loop:

\end{center}
\caption{Reinforcing feedback loop}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
For example, we can consider \textquotedblleft{}rabbit reproduction\textquotedblright{} as a process with a reinforcing feedback loop:
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/2_00-rabbits.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/2_00-rabbits.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/2_00-rabbits.png}}}}{rabbits}
\end{center}
\caption{Reinforcing (positive?) feedback, with rabbits}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
The more rabbits, the faster they reproduce, and the more rabbits. This is sometimes called a \textquotedblleft{}positive\textquotedblright{} feedback loop, although Mr. MacGregor the local gardener may not agree, given that they are eating all his cabbages!! This is why feedback experts (e.g. \hyperlink{Sterman2000}{[Sterman2000]}) prefer to call this \textquotedblleft{}reinforcing\textquotedblright{} feedback, because there is not necessarily anything \textquotedblleft{}positive\textquotedblright{} about it.
 
We can also consider feedback as the relationship between TWO processes:
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/2_00-balancing.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/2_00-balancing.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/2_00-balancing.png}}}}{feedback between 2 processes}
\end{center}
\caption{Balancing feedback between two processes}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
In our rabbit example, what if Process B is fox reproduction, that is, the birth rate of foxes (who eat rabbits)?
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/2_00-rabbitfox.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/2_00-rabbitfox.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/2_00-rabbitfox.png}}}}{rabbits and foxes}
\end{center}
\caption{Balancing (negative?) feedback, with rabbits and foxes}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
More rabbits equals more foxes (notice the \textquotedblleft{}+\textquotedblright{} symbol on the line), because there are more rabbits to eat! But what does this do to the rabbits? It means LESS rabbits. Which, ultimately, means less foxes\ldots{} and at some point, the populations balance. This is classic negative feedback. However, the local foxes don't see it as negative (nor do the local gardeners!)  That is why feedback experts prefer to call this \textquotedblleft{}balancing\textquotedblright{} feedback.
 
Wikipedia has good articles on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_loop_diagram}{Causal Loop Diagramming} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_dynamics}{Systems Dynamics} (with cool dynamic visuals.) \hyperlink{Sterman2000}{[Sterman2000]} is the definitive text with applications.
 \begin{DBKadmonition}{}{Note}
 
Still confused? Think about the last time you saw a "reply-{}all" email storm. The first accidental mass send generates feedback (emails saying "take me off this list"), which generate more emails ("stop emailing the list") and so on. This does not continue indefinitely; management intervention, common sense and fatigue eventually damp the storm down.
