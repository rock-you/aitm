\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{_conclusion_8}\hyperlabel{_conclusion_8}%
  
Organizational development is always an ongoing process of balancing culture, centralization, and autonomy. Rather than seeking any "best practice," it is better to see a toolbox, or perhaps a set of levers you can position in various ways to get different results. As of 2015, product-{}centric Agile teams are becoming more and more common. But there are ultimately limitations to this approach, which many companies have experienced.
 
Culture can be difficult to define. We saw how Toyota's success can be understood as a strategy of ingraining particular cultural understandings through pervasive coaching.
 
Finally, hiring and managing people is a critical concern for digital organizations as with all organizations. Issues of motivation and accountability are becoming better understood, and practices recently seen as "best" (such as forced ranking) are now being abandoned in favor of more team-{}oriented approaches.
