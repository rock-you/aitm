\section{Appendix: Process modeling}
\label{_appendix_process_modeling}\hyperlabel{_appendix_process_modeling}%
  
Process management is grounded in business fundamentals. Businesses convert inputs (capital, materials, staff talent) into valuable outputs and generate valuable surplus (margin) for shareholders and other stakeholders.
 
This act of \textbf{conversion} is a \textbf{process}. The overall process has been described by Michael Porter as a "value chain."

Note the progression along the bottom: first, raw materials are acquired, then manufactured, then distributed at which point they are marketed and sold, and ultimately serviced. Porter termed this set of activities "Primary." The upper half represents what Porter termed "support." Supporting activities represent necessary, but not value adding, functions.
 
There are many criticisms of the Porter value chain. Without research and development, there is no product, so why is it considered a support activity (and confusingly named just "Technology Development")? Surely, marketing and sales help drive demand for the product, especially with manufacturing lead times shrinking, so why do they appear so late in the game? Overall, the model represents a manufacturing-{}centric world where customers were happy to buy what was on offer. However, this does not change the fact that most value has some rough ordering to it (it is difficult to sell and service a product before you invent and produce it), and the idea that some activities are primary while others are supporting also is useful.
 
The value chain as a whole is high level. We can think of a large company in these terms, but we cannot easily manage it this way. Value chains therefore are the ultimate "process" but in order for process to have value, we need to take it down a level or two.
 
In order to do this, we should clarify some terms.
