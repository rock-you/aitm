\subsection{COBIT}
\label{_cobit}\hyperlabel{_cobit}%
  
COBIT (originally the Control Objectives for Information Technology) is a set of guidance from ISACA (originally the IS Audit and Control Association). It has a broader scope than ITIL, as it includes architecture and project management. Where ITIL contains lengthy and detailed narrative, COBIT is more terse and structured.
 
We will discuss the concepts of IT governance and controls in the next section, and therefore at this point in the reading are not completely ready to evaluate COBIT in terms of its initial objectives. (In COBIT terms, processes are just one of various "\hyperlink{enablers}{enablers}" that can serve as controls for enterprise risk.) However, COBIT is widely used as a reference for understanding IT organizational processes and activities, and is discussed in that sense in this chapter.
 
The following processes are suggested by COBIT for IT management and goverance. (\emph{Governance}, the "EDM" processes, is very clearly distinguished from \emph{management} in COBIT. We will discuss this in Chapter 10.)
 
As COBIT notes, "The proposed process model is a complete, comprehensive model, but it is not the only possible process model. Each enterprise must define its own process set, taking into account its specific situation." \hyperlink{ISACA2012a}{[ISACA2012a]}, p.32.
 
COBIT is strongly supportive of the standard CMMI/ISO/IEC 15504 process maturity progression and therefore is subject to the previous criticisms regarding the suitability of this approach for digital management, especially research and development processes and other less repeatable activities.

Each process is further elaborated into practices. For example, the process APO08 (Manage Relationships) has the following management practices:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} APO08\_01 Understand business expectations.
 

\item{} APO08\_02 Identify opportunities, risk and constraints for IT to enhance the business.
 

\item{} APO08\_03 Manage the business relationship.
 

\item{} APO08\_04 Co-{}ordinate and communicate.
 

\item{} APO08\_05 Provide input to the continual improvement of services.
 
\end{itemize}
 
Inputs and outputs are documented at the management practice level.
