The design and architecture of applications is a large topic (see e.g. \hyperlink{Gamma1995}{[Gamma1995]} and \hyperlink{Fowler2003}{[Fowler2003]}) and this text only touches lightly on it. \href{http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/defining-architecture.html}{ISO/\-IEC 41010} defines architecture as \textquotedblleft{}the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.\textquotedblright{}
 
A computer program can be as simple as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program}{Hello World.} Such a program requires only one or a few files to compile and execute. However, significant applications such as an online video streaming service require hardware and software configurations of \href{http://techblog.netflix.com/search/label/cloud%20architecture}{tremendous complexity}.  Specialized visual notations are used to describe this complexity, as in the image above. We will discuss this further in Chapter 12.
  
\subsubsection{Applications and project management}
\label{_applications_and_project_management}\hyperlabel{_applications_and_project_management}%
  
Because the initial applications were implemented as a kind of systems engineering, and were expensive to build and maintain, the technique of choice was \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management}{project management}. Project management will not be covered in this book until Part III, as it is not appropriate to the earlier stages of this book's \href{http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_a_process_of_emergence}{emergence model}.
 
This history of project managed systems engineering produced any number of successes, but by the early 1990s there were significant concerns with the rate of large project failures \hyperlink{Glass1998}{[Glass1998]}, which occurred despite seemingly extensive and rigorous bureaucratic overhead, evidenced by frameworks such as \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration}{CMMI} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge}{PMBOK}. \footnote{
Both project management and CMMI have come in for significant criticism \hyperlink{Koskela2002}{[Koskela2002]}, \hyperlink{Keefer2006}{[Keefer2006]}, and will be discussed further in Sections 3 and 4.
