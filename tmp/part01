\emph{The Digital Professional is a perfect fit for my Management Information Systems class to introduce students to the fast-{}paced world of IT Infrastructure that they will be dealing with shortly upon graduation.  This book uses multiple perspectives (Founder, Team Leader, VP, C-{}level executive) to demonstrate to the student not only how a business grows, but how they need to continually grow their skill set.  The use of hands-{}on exercises encouraged by the format of this book complements my teaching style that allows students to learn by doing, failing and doing again.  An additional benefit is that this book begins with a focus on the startup mentality which I will use in my Business Innovation class.}
