\section{For the student}

This is a \emph{survey} text intended for the advanced undergraduate or graduate student interested in the general field of applied IT management. It is grounded in basic computing fundamentals but does not require any particular technical skills to understand. You do not need to have taken any courses in networking, security, or specific programming languages to understand this book. However, you will be presented with material on such topics, including fragments of programming languages and pseudocode, and you will need to be willing to invest the time and effort to understand.
 
This book makes frequent reference to digital startups\textemdash{}early stage companies bringing new products to market that are primarily delivered as some form of computer-{}based service. Whether or not you intend to pursue such endeavors, the startup journey is a powerful frame for your learning. Large information technology organizations in enterprises sometimes gain a reputation for losing sight of business value. IT seems to be acquired and operated for its own sake. Statements like \textquotedblleft{}we need to align IT with the business!\textquotedblright{} are too often heard.
 
A digital startup exposes with great clarity the linkage between IT and \textquotedblleft{}the business.\textquotedblright{} The success or failure of the company itself depends on the adept and responsive creation and deployment of the software-{}based systems. Market revenues arrive, or do not, based on digital product strategy and the priorities chosen. Features the market doesn't need? You won't have the money to stay in business. Great features, but your product is unstable and unreliable? Your customers will go to the competition.
 
The lessons that digital entrepreneurs have learned through this trial by fire shed great light on IT's value to the business. Thinking about a startup allows us to consider the most fundamental principles as a sort of microcosm, a small laboratory model of the same problems that the largest enterprises face.
 
Verne Harnish, in the book \emph{Scaling Up} (\hyperlink{Harnish2014}{[Harnish2014]}, pp-{}25-{}26), describes how companies tend to cluster at certain levels of scale. The majority of firms never grow beyond a founder; a small percentage emerge as a viable team of 8-{}12, and even smaller numbers make it to the stable plateaus of 40-{}70 and 350-{}500. This scaling model, and the needs that emerge as companies grow, is the basis for this book's learning progression.

However, this is not a textbook (or course) on entrepreneurship. It remains IT-{}centric. \textbf{And, the book is also intended to be relevant to students entering directly into large, established enterprises.} In fact, it prepares the student for working in all stages of growth because it progresses through these four contexts:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Individual (founder)
 

\item{} Team
 

\item{} Small company (team of teams)
 

\item{} Enterprise
 
\end{itemize}
 
Whether in a startup or on a journey within a larger, established organization, you will (hopefully) become aware as you progress through a broadening context:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Other team members
 

\item{} Customers
 

\item{} Suppliers
 

\item{} Sponsors
 

\item{} Necessary non-{}IT capabilities (finance, legal, HR, sales, marketing, etc.)
 

\item{} Channel partners
 

\item{} Senior executives and funders
 

\item{} Auditors and regulators
 
\end{itemize}
 
Part of maturing in one's career is understanding how all these relationships figure into your own overall system of value delivery. This will be a lifelong journey for the student; the author's intent is to provide some useful tools.
