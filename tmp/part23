\subsection{Conclusion}

In this chapter, we discussed the basic questions of information technology value and how it is experienced and developed. Through the mechanism of a hypothetical modern IT user, we covered (at a \textbf{very} high level) the necessary ingredients of the IT experience. We considered the user's moment of truth, and the massive IT complexity that sustains it. We also discussed a high level lifecycle model for IT applications and services, and explored some initial definitions for user, customer, and sponsor -{} critical distinctions to make in an age of digital transformation.
 
As you proceed into the course, the key takeway from this chapter is "why IT?" Why do people need it, and how is it valuable? That should always remain at the top of your mind as you proceed in your IT education.
