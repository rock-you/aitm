What is culture in this context? It is not so much about an informal dress code, flexible hours, or a free in-{}house cafeteria as it is about how decisions are taken, norms of behavior, protocols of communication, and the ways of navigating hierarchy and bureaucracy to get things done.

\emph{Agile IT Organization Design} \end{quote}
 
"Culture" is a difficult term to define, and even more difficult to characterize across large organizations. It starts with how an organization is formally structured, as structure is in part a set of expectations around how information flows. "Who talks to who, when and why" is in a sense culture. Culture can also be seen embedded in artifacts like processes and formally specified operating models.
 
But "culture" has additional, less tangible meanings. The anecdotes executives choose to repeat are culture. Whether an organization tacitly condones being 5 minutes late for meetings (because walk time in large facilities is expected) or has little tolerance for this (because most people dial in) is culture. The degree of deference shown to senior executives, and their opinions, is culture. Whether a junior person dares to hit "reply-{}all" on an email including her boss's boss is culture.
 
Culture cannot be directly changed -{} it is better seen as a lagging indicator, that changes in response to specific practical interventions. Even tools and processes can change culture, if they are judiciously chosen (and most tools and processes do \textbf{not} have this effect). Skeptical? Consider the impact that computers -{} a tool -{} have had on culture. Or email.
 
We've already touched on culture in the chapter 4 discussion of \hyperlink{psych-safety}{team formation.} These themes of psychological safety, equal collaboration, emotional awareness and diversity inform our further discussions. We'll look at culture from a few additional perspectives in this section:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Motivation
 

\item{} Schneider matrix
 

\item{} The Westrum typology
 

\item{} Mike Rother's research into Toyota's improvement and coaching "katas"
 
\end{itemize}
 
\label{motivation}\hyperlabel{motivation}
 
\subsubsection{Motivation}
\label{_motivation}\hyperlabel{_motivation}%
  
One of the most important reasons to be concerned for culture is its effect on motivation. There is little doubt that a more motivated team performs better than an unmotivated, "going through the motions" organization. But what motivates people?
 
One of the oldest discussions of culture is Douglas McGregor's idea of \href{http://www.wikipedia.org/}{Theory X} organizations, which he developed in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
 
"Theory X" organizations rely on extrinsic motivators and operate on the assumption that workers must be cajoled and punished in order to produce results. We see Theory X approaches when organizations focus on pay scales, bonuses, titles, awards, writeups/demerits, performance appraisals, and the like.
 
Theory Y organizations operate on the assumption that most people seek meaningful work intrinsically and that they have the ability to solve problems in creative ways that do not require tight standardization. According to Theory Y, people can be trusted and should be treated as mature individuals, in contrast to the distrust inherent in Theory X.
 
Related to theory Y, in terms of intrinsic motivation, Daniel Pink, author of Drive, suggests that three concepts are key: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. If these three qualities are experienced by individuals and teams, they will be more likely to feel motivated and collaborate more effectively.

\subsubsection{Schneider and Westrum}
\label{_schneider_and_westrum}\hyperlabel{_schneider_and_westrum}%
  
One model for understanding culture is the following matrix proposed by William Schneider:
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/3_07-Schneider-matrix.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/3_07-Schneider-matrix.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/3_07-Schneider-matrix.png}}}}{matrix}
\end{center}
\caption[{Schneider matrix (based on [Schneider1999])}]{Schneider matrix (based on \hyperlink{Schneider1999}{[Schneider1999]})}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
Two dimensions are proposed:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} the extent to which the culture is focused on the company or the individual
 

\item{} the extent to which the company is "possibility-{}oriented" versus "reality-{}oriented"
 
\end{itemize}
 
This is not a neutral matrix. It's not clear that highly controlling cultures are ever truly effective. Even in the military, which is generally assumed to be the ultimate "command and control" culture, there are notable case studies of increased performance when more empowering approaches were encouraged.
 

\begin{sidebar}
\textbf{Is the military "command and control"?}


Military commanders realized as long ago as the Napoleonic wars that denying soldiers and commanders autonomy in the field was a good way to lose battles. Even in peacetime operations, forward-{}thinking military commanders continue to focus on "what, not how."

In \emph{Turn the Ship Around: A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders}, Captain L. David Marquette discusses moving from a command-{}driven to an outcome-{}driven model and the beneficial results it had on the \emph{USS Santa Fe} \hyperlink{Marquet2013}{[Marquet2013]}. Similar themes appear in Captain D. Michael Abrashoff's \emph{It's Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy} \hyperlink{Abrashoff2012}{[Abrashoff2012]}.

Neither of these accounts is surprising, when one considers the more sophisticated aspects of military doctrine. Don Reinertsen provides a rigorous overview in chapter 9 of \emph{Principles of Product Development Flow}. In this discussion, he notes that the military has been experimenting with centralized vs. decentralized control for centuries. Modern warfighting relies on autonomous, self-{}directed teams that may be out of touch with central command and required to improvise effectively to achieve the mission.  Therefore, military orders are incomplete without a statement of "commander's intent" -{} the ultimate outcome of the mission. \hyperlink{Reinertsen2009}{[Reinertsen2009]}, pp. 243-{}265. Military leaders are concerned with pathological "toxic command" which is just as destructive in the military as anywhere else \hyperlink{Vergun2015}{[Vergun2015]}.
\end{sidebar}
 
Similar to the Schneider matrix is the Westrum typology, which proposes that there are three major types of culture:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Pathological
 

\item{} Bureaucratic
 

\item{} Generative
 
\end{itemize}
 
The cultural types exhibit the following behaviors:

The State of DevOps research has demonstrated a correlation between generative cultures and digital business effectiveness \hyperlink{Puppet2015}{[Puppet2015]}, \hyperlink{Forsgren2016}{[Forsgren2016]}. Notice also the relationship to \hyperlink{blameless-postmortems}{blameless postmortems} discussed in Chapter 6.

\textbf{State of DevOps survey research}


DevOps is a broad term, first introduced in \hyperlink{continuous-delivery}{Chapter 3}. As noted in that chapter, DevOps includes continuous delivery, team behavior and product management, and culture. Puppet Labs has sponsored an annual survey for the last 5 years, the \emph{State of DevOps} report. It consists of 5 annual surveys with 25,000 individual data points. It shows a variety of correlations including:
\begin{itemize}

\item{} Core continuous delivery practices such as version control, test automation, deployment automation, and continuous integration increase team engagement and IT and organizational performance
 

\item{} Lean product management approaches such as seeking fast feedback and splitting work into small batches also increase team engagement and IT and organizational performance \hyperlink{Forsgren2016}{[Forsgren2016]}.

  \begin{quote}

Six years ago I began the research that led to [Toyota Kata] thinking, like just about everyone else, that the story was about techniques and other listable aspects of Toyota. Today I see Toyota in a notably different light: as an organization defined primarily by the unique behavior routines it continually teaches to all its members.

\hspace*\fill--- Mike Rother
\emph{Toyota Kata} \end{quote}
 
Academics and consultants have been studying Toyota for many years. The performance and influence of the Japanese automaker is legendary, but it has been difficult to understand why.
 
Much has been written about Toyota's use of particular tools, such as kanban bins and andon boards. However, Toyota views these as ephemeral adaptations to the demands of its business.

\end{center}
\caption[{Toyota kata, similar to [Rother2010]}]{Toyota kata, similar to \hyperlink{Rother2010}{[Rother2010]}}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
According to Mike Rother in \emph{Toyota Kata} \hyperlink{Rother2010}{[Rother2010]},  underlying Toyota's particular tools and techniques are two powerful practices:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} The improvement kata
 

\item{} The coaching kata
 
\end{itemize}
 
What is a \emph{kata}? It is a Japanese word stemming from the martial arts, meaning pattern, routine, or drill. More deeply, it means "a way of keeping two things in alignment with each other." The improvement kata is the repeated process by which Toyota managers investigate and resolve problems, in a hands-{}on, fact-{}based, and preconception-{}free manner, and improve processes towards a "target operating condition." The coaching kata is how the improvement kata is instilled in new generations of Toyota managers.
 
As Rother describes it, the coaching and improvement katas establish and reinforce a coherent culture or mental model of how goals are achieved and problems approached. It is understood that human judgement is not accurate or impartial. The method compensates with a teaching-{}by-{}example focus on seeking facts without preconceived notions, through direct, hands-{}on investigation and experimental approaches.
 
This is not something that can be formalized into a simple checklist or process; it requires many guided examples and applications before the approach becomes ingrained in the upcoming manager.
