\subsubsection{Critical chain}
\label{_critical_chain}\hyperlabel{_critical_chain}%
  
Author Eli Goldratt in the book Critical Chain develops a sophisticated critique of project estimation and the dysfunctions it promotes.
 
In a project requiring contributions from multiple skilled resources, a common practice is to ask each person, "how long will this take you?" The project manager then works the resulting estimates into the overall project plan.
 
The problem with this is that most people will estimate their time conservatively; they will forecast a longer duration than they actually require. When all these "padded" estimates are added together, the project may be unacceptably long. The agreed work will tend to expand to fill the time available (Parkinson's Law). Furthermore, most people will wait until the end of their window to perform their task -{} a person who asks for 3 weeks to perform one week of work will often not start until week 3. (Otherwise known as Student Syndrome.)
 
One of the reasons that people estimate conservatively is that project managers tend to be quite concerned if committed tasks are not performed on time. Failure to make the "deliverable" by the committed date may result in negative feedback to the employee's manager and resulting poor performance reviews.
 
Coupled with the above-{}cited drive to multi-{}tasking, these factors result in poor project performance, despite the array of modern project management techniques.
 
Goldratt suggested an alternate approach, in which the idea of "critical path" is enhanced with resource awareness. That is to say, the issue of timing and dependencies (itself a complex problem) is further enriched with the availability of resources to perform the work. (In general, the availability of assigned project resources is assumed, but this is not a wise assumption in project-{}centric environments.)
 
Estimation is handled more probabilistically, and the "critical chain" is \textbf{the combination of the critical path plus the resource assigned to complete the most critical task.} The theory is that a person performing such a task must be protected from distraction, and in fact project managers must expand their tools to effectively forecast and plan the critical chain.
 
This leads to some complex math, in particular a known problem called the Resource-{}Constrained Scheduling Problem. (e.g. \href{http://www.iste.co.uk/data/doc_dtalmanhopmh.pdf}{http://www.iste.co.uk/\-data/\-doc\_dtalmanhopmh.pdf}) The fact that this problem is so notoriously difficult is indicative of the need for adaptive approaches; ultimately, rigorous analytic methods fail to cope with the complexity of such problems.
 
Craig Larman, in Scaling Lean and Agile Development, is sympathetic to the overall insights and goals of Critical Chain. However, with respect the full blown analytical approach it implies, he states
 
"We have seen two very large official "project management TOC" adoption attempts (and heard of one more) in companies developing software-{}intensive embedded systems\ldots{}\hspace{0em} The practice was clearly heavy, not agile, and not lean. In all three cases, the approach was eventually found cumbersome and not very effective, and was dropped." \hyperlink{Larman2009}{[Larman2009]}
  
\subsubsection{The Agile project frameworks}
\label{_the_agile_project_frameworks}\hyperlabel{_the_agile_project_frameworks}%
  
As of this writing, a number of frameworks have been developed at the intersection of Agile and project management. Notable examples include:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} The Scaled Agile Framework (\href{http://www.scaledagileframework.com/}{http://www.scaledagileframework.com/\-})
 

\item{} Disciplined Agile Delivery (\href{http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/}{http://www.disciplinedagiledelivery.com/\-})
 
\end{itemize}
 
Other Agile authors are skeptical of the need for such material \hyperlink{Schwaber2013}{[Schwaber2013]}.
