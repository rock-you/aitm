This section briefly describes a number of key architecture standards for the student's reference.
 
\subsubsection{Business architecture}

  \begin{DBKadmonition}{}{Note}
 
We previously discussed the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge. Although they have similar names, BABOK and BIZBOK are distinct in terms of content and their sponsoring organizations.
 \end{DBKadmonition}
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} The \emph{Business Analysis Body of Knowledge} (BABOK), from the International Institute of Business Analysis \hyperlink{IIBA2015}{[IIBA2015]}, focuses on business analysis: "the practice of enabling change in an enterprise by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to stakeholders."
 

\item{} The Business Architecture Body of Knowledge (BIZBOK) is a broader, more diverse set of guidance from the BA Guild\hyperlink{BAGuild2016}{[BAGuild2016]}. It defines business architecture as "a blueprint of the enterprise that provides a common understanding of the organization and is used to align strategic objectives and tactical demands."
 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{TOGAF}
\label{_togaf}\hyperlabel{_togaf}%
  
The Open Group Architecture Framework is a general purpose framework and method, currently in Version 9 \hyperlink{Open2009}{[Open2009]}. TOGAF dates from 1995 and is based on even earlier work from the US Department of Defense, dating back to 1986.
  
\subsubsection{Archimate}
\label{_archimate}\hyperlabel{_archimate}%
  
Archimate is an architectural notation specification, now owned by The Open Group.

\subsubsection{Industry verticals}
\label{_industry_verticals}\hyperlabel{_industry_verticals}%
  
Industry sectors often develop architectural representations of their concerns. Examples include:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Association for Retail Standards (National Retail Federation)
 

\item{} Banking Information Architecture Network (BIAN)
 

\item{} The Enhanced Telecom Operating Model and related work of the Tele-{}Management Forum
 

\item{} The ACORD architecture for insurance
 

\item{} The  Exploration, Mining, Metals and Minerals (EMMM\texttrademark{}) Forum of The Open Group
 
\end{itemize}
  
\subsubsection{Governmental frameworks}
\label{_governmental_frameworks}\hyperlabel{_governmental_frameworks}%
  
Governmental architecture frameworks are often used to standardize architecture, for example:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} The U.S. Federal Enterprise Architecture Framework (FEAF)
 

\item{} The U.S. Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DODAF)
 

\item{} The U.K. Ministry of Defense Architecture Framework (MODAF)
 
\end{itemize}
