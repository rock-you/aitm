When we combine the three dimensions:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Size of work;
 

\item{} Time horizon; and
 

\item{} Predictability
 
\end{itemize}
 
we get the Betz organizational scaling cube. It shows the three dimensions we'll consider throughout Part III. The accompanying cube shows these dimensions visually. The three dimensions represent a space to understand work, resource, and planning as we scale the organization.
 
The z-{}axis of variability can be seen as a progression along the first four \hyperlink{cynefin}{Cynefin} domains (see sidebar). At the origin at lower left, we have predictable, small-{}grained work occurring in short "planning" horizons (e.g. automated transactions running on computers.) As we scale out to larger domains of work, longer time frames, and greater variability in planning, we encounter the problems of growth, coordination, strategy, and the fundamental uncertainties of operating in a chaotic, competitive world.
