\subsection{Introduction}
\label{_introduction_3}\hyperlabel{_introduction_3}%
  
Now that we have some idea of IT value (and how we might turn it into a product), and have decided on some infrastructure, we can start building.
 
IT systems that directly create value for non-{}technical users are usually called "applications," or sometimes "services." As discussed in chapter 1, they enable value experiences in areas as diverse as consumer banking, entertainment and hospitality, and personal transportation. In fact it is difficult to think of any aspect of modern life untouched by applications. (This overall trend is sometimes called digital transformation.)
 
Applications are built from software, the development of which is a core concern for any IT-{}centric product strategy. Software development is a well established career, and a fast-{}moving field with new technologies, frameworks, and schools of thought emerging weekly, it seems. This chapter will cover applications and the software lifecycle, from requirements through construction, testing, building, and deployment into modern production environments. It also discusses earlier approaches to software development, the rise of the Agile movement, and its current manifestation in the practice of DevOps.
