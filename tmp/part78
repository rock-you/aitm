Avoid large projects. Start small and quickly develop a product with the minimum functionality\ldots{}\hspace{0em} If you have to employ a large project, scale slowly and grow the project organically by adding one team at a time. Starting with too many people causes products to be overly complex, making future product updates time-{}consuming and expensive.

As we begin the second half of this book, consider Pichler's advice above. We have spent chapters 1-{}6 (the first half of the book) thinking mainly in terms of one product and its dimensions. We are  scaling now because we must; we have increasingly diverse product opportunities, or one product that has become so large it must be  \hyperlink{AKF-cube}{partitioned} in some manner. Or both.
