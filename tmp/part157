There are hundreds of books on Agile. In this part I will seek to credit specifically collegiate texts that may also be of interest.

 \begin{itemize}

\item{} While not an academic text per se, does have user questions and exercises at end of chapters; I currently use as supplementary text and am scoping this one to complement it
