Many other frameworks exist, under varying governance models from open to proprietary. An up to date list is maintained by Van Haren Publishing in their publication Global Standards and Publications (Van Haren Publishing, 2016). There are Agile frameworks such as the Scaled Agile Framework, although at this writing these are mostly proprietary. Finally, there is a broad ecosystem of vendor-{}specific certifications as well, to educate practitioners in the specifics of various commercial products.
