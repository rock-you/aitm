Now agile methodologies\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}which involve new values, principles, practices, and benefits and are a radical alternative to command-{}and-{}control-{}style management\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}are spreading across a broad range of industries and functions and even into the C-{}suite.

As an instructor, I ask you to consider the following two industry reports.
 
In September 2015, Minneapolis-{}based Target Corporation laid off 275 workers with IT skillsets such as business analysis and project management, while simultaneously hiring workers with newer \textquotedblleft{}Agile\textquotedblright{} skills. As quoted by a local news site, Target stated:
 
\emph{\textquotedblleft{}As a part of our transition to an Agile technology development and support model, we conducted a comprehensive review of our current structure and capabilities\ldots{} we are eliminating approximately 275 positions and closing an additional 35 open positions. The majority of the impact was across our technology teams and was primarily focused on areas such business analysis and project management.\textquotedblright{} \hyperlink{KARE2015}{[KARE2015]}}
 
Jim Fowler, Chief Information Officer at General Electric, says:
 
\emph{\textquotedblleft{}When I am in business meetings, I hear people talk about digital as a function or a role. It is not. Digital is a capability that needs to exist in every job. Twenty years ago, we broke ecommerce out into its own organization, and today ecommerce is just a part of the way we work. That's where digital and IT are headed; IT will be no longer be a distinct function, it will just be the way we work. \ldots{} [W]e've moved to a flatter organizational model with \textquotedblleft{}teams of teams\textquotedblright{} who are focused on outcomes. These are co-{}located groups of people who own a small, minimal viable product deliverable that they can produce in 90 days. The team focuses on one piece of work that they will own through its complete lifecycle\ldots{}in [the \textquotedblleft{}back office\textquotedblright{}] model, the CIO controls infrastructure, the network, storage, and makes the PCs run. The CIOs who choose to play that role will not be relevant for long.\textquotedblright{} \hyperlink{Heller2016}{[Heller2016]}}
 
Modern information systems (MIS) texts, especially at the undergraduate, survey level, take an \textquotedblleft{}outside-{}in\textquotedblright{} approach to the course material, seeking to orient \textbf{all} students (whether IT/MIS specialists or not) to the role and function of information systems and their possibilities and value in the modern enterprise. This book, by contrast, is an \textquotedblleft{}inside-{}out\textquotedblright{} book intended to prepare the student for a career in digital industry. \emph{Industry} is broadly defined as both those industries that offer digital products per se as well as industries that rely on digital technology instrumentally for delivering all kinds of products. A central theme of the book is that IT, considered as a component, represents an increasing proportion of \textbf{all} industrial products (both consumer and business-{}facing). This is known as digital transformation.
 
Current MIS survey texts have some common characteristics:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} They tend to focus on the largest organizations and their applications of computing. This can lead to puzzling topic choices; for example, in one text, one of the first sections is dedicated to the problem of enterprise IT asset management\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}a narrow topic for the earlier sections of a survey course and increasingly irrelevant in the age of the cloud.
 

\item{} Their learning progression (structure and narrative) is often arbitrary; for example, covering databases, networking, ERP systems, security, and so forth in various orderings.
 

\item{} They do not (and this is a primary failing) cover Agile and its associated digital ecosystem at all well. Brief mentions of Agile may appear in sections on project management, but in general there is a lack of awareness of the fundamental characteristics of digital transformation and the critical role of Agile and related methods in accelerating digital transformation.
 

\item{} Their coverage of cloud infrastructure also tends to be limited, even with new editions coming out every year.
 

\item{} Finally, current texts often uncritically accept and cite \textquotedblleft{}best practice\textquotedblright{} IT frameworks such as CMMI, ITIL, PMBOK, and COBIT. New digital organizations do not, in general, use such guidance, and the industry at the time of this writing is rife with controversy as to the value and future of these frameworks. This book provides a clear and objective overview of these critical issues.
 
\end{itemize}
 
IT, or the digital function, has had a history of being under-{}managed and poorly understood relative to peer functions in the enterprise. It struggles with a reputation for expensive inflexibility and Dilbert-{}esque dysfunction. The DevOps and Agile movements promise transformation but are encountering an entrenched legacy of
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} enterprise architecture;
 

\item{} program and project management;
 

\item{} business process management;
 

\item{} IT service management practices; and
 

\item{} IT governance concerns.
 
\end{itemize}
 
Understanding and engaging with the challenges of this legacy are an ongoing theme throughout this introductory text. Some of the more radical voices in the Agile movement sometimes give the impression that the legacy can be simply swept away. The following cautionary message from Mike Burrows shows that, in terms of core Agile philosophy, this would be ill-{}advised:
 
\emph{\textquotedblleft{}Some will tell you that when things are this bad, you throw it all away and start again. It's ironic: The same people who would champion incremental and evolutionary approaches to product development seem only too eager to recommend disruptive and revolutionary changes in people-{}based systems\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}in which the outcomes are so much less certain.\textquotedblright{}} \hyperlink{Burrows2014}{[Burrows2014]}, Kindle locations 827\textendash{}829.
 
IT management at scale within an organization is a complex system. The IT workforce and its ongoing development (through education and training) is another complex system orders of magnitude larger. Complex systems do not respond well to dramatic perturbations. They are best changed incrementally, with careful monitoring of the consequences of each small change. (This is part of the systems theory foundation underlying the Agile movement.) This is why the book, especially in the later chapters, starts with relatively straightforward and uncritical presentations of the following topics:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Investment, sourcing, and people
 

\item{} Project and process management
 

\item{} Governance, risk, security, and compliance
 

\item{} Enterprise information management
 

\item{} Enterprise architecture and portfolio management
 
\end{itemize}
 
While these practices, and their associated approaches and policies, have caused friction with digital and Agile practitioners, they all have their reasons for existing. The goal of this book is to understand their interaction with the new digital approaches, but in order to do this we must first understand them on their own terms. It does no good to develop a critique based on misconceptions or exaggerations about what (for example) process management or governance is all about. Instead, we try to break these large and sometimes controversial topics into smaller, more specific topics\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}lowest common denominators, perhaps as follows:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Work and effort
 

\item{} Ordering of tasks
 

\item{} Task dependencies
 

\item{} Planned versus unplanned work
 

\item{} Estimation versus commitment
 

\item{} Value stream versus skill alignment
 

\item{} Repeatability
 

\item{} Defined versus empirical process control
 

\item{} Synchronization and cadence
 

\item{} Resource demand
 

\item{} Shared mental models
 

\item{} Mission objectives versus perimeter defense
 

\item{} Technical debt
 

\item{} Risk
 

\item{} And so forth
 
\end{itemize}
 
By examining IT management in these more neutral, specific terms, we can develop a responsible critique of current industry best practices in content and form that will benefit students as they go out on their careers.
