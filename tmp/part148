The Project Management Body of Knowledge is a publication of the Project Management Institute. It represents the codification of formal project management knowledge. There is a comparable Axelos publication, Prince2, not covered here. PMI describes itself as:
 
\emph{the world's leading not-{}for-{}profit professional membership association for the project, program and portfolio management profession. Founded in 1969, PMI delivers value for more than 2.9 million professionals working in nearly every country in the world through global advocacy, collaboration, education and research. PMI advances careers, improves organizational success and further matures the profession of project management through its globally recognized standards, certifications, resources, tools, academic research, publications, professional development courses, and networking opportunities} (from \href{http://www.pmi.org/About-Us.aspx}{www.pmi.org}).
 
The Project Management Body of Knowledge is articulated in a publication, \emph{A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowlege.} While this may seem to imply that the PMBOK and its guide are two different things, they are not\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}it is one publication. The PMBOK, as of the latest edition, consists of:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} 47 Project Management "processes," grouped into
 

\item{} 5 Project Management process "groups" and
 

\item{} 10 Project Management "knowledge areas"
 
\end{itemize}
 
The groups are the easiest to start with. They are:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Initiating
 

\item{} Planning
 

\item{} Executing
 

\item{} Monitoring and Controlling
 

\item{} Closing
 
\end{itemize}
 
The PMBOK is clear that the "Process Groups are not project phases. In fact, it is possible that all Process Groups could be conducted within a phase." \hyperlink{PMI2013}{[PMI2013]}, A1.3.
 
The Knowledge Areas are a different dimension, and consist of:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Project Integration Management
 

\item{} Project Scope Management
 

\item{} Project Time Management
 

\item{} Project Cost Management
 

\item{} Project Quality Management
 

\item{} Project Human Resource Management
 

\item{} Project Communication Management
 

\item{} Project Risk Management
 

\item{} Project Procurement Management
 

\item{} Project Stakeholder Management
 
\end{itemize}
 
Finally, the 47 project management "processes" include topics such as (selected items):
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Develop Project Charter
 

\item{} Develop Project Management Plan
 

\item{} Direct and Manage Project Work
 

\item{} Perform Integrated Change Control
 
\end{itemize}
 
Each process is categorized by one Process Group and one Knowledge Area, resulting in a matrix. A full matrix is not presented here due to copyright concerns, but one can be seen \href{http://www.focus-on-training.co.uk/blog/pmbok-process-groups-knowledge-areas}{here}.
