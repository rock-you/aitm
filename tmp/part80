This third dimension of variability is challenging to understand and touches on our earlier discussion of \hyperlink{systems-thinking}{systems thinking}. A helpful framework to understand it is the Cynefin framework, by Dave Snowden and Cynthia Kurtz \hyperlink{Kurtz2003}{[Kurtz2003]}. Cynefin proposes that there are five major domains useful in understanding situations:
\begin{itemize}

\item{} Simple/Obvious
 

\item{} Complicated
 

\item{} Complex
 

\item{} Chaotic
 

\item{} Disorder
 
\end{itemize}

The \textbf{simple or obvious} domain is straightforward, repeatable, and cause and effect are known. The concept of "best practice" applies. The mode of action is to sense, categorize, and respond.

\end{center}

The \textbf{complicated} domain requires analysis and expertise; there may be several right or at least serviceable answers. Rational thought is possible and cause and effect relationships may be more challenging to understand, but still are applicable. Mode of action is to sense, analyze, and respond.

The \textbf{complex} domain is that of systems thinking. Cause and effect are apparent only in hindsight. Interdependencies complicate action. Reinforcing loops can quickly accelerate, making linear assumptions hazardous, or conversely, counterbalancing loops kick in and prevent desired changes from happening. Mode of action is to probe, sense, and respond ("probe" being to make a small change.) Much of modern product development and DevOps thinking is optimized for this domain, because simple and rational approaches have so frequently failed.

In the \textbf{chaotic} domain, cause and effect are not apparent even in hindsight. The situation is completely unpredictable, and action is essential -{} better to act in any direction than be paralyzed. The mode of action is to act, sense, and respond.

Finally, \textbf{disorder} is considered to be the domain you're in when you have not figured out which of the other four applies.

The two dimensional model above does not describe how uncertain work is, however. The predictability of the work is also independent. You might have two projects, both taking the same effort. One of them you were able to predict easily, while the other one was not predictable -{} more precisely, your expected time, effort and cost was a long way off from what you wound up spending. (Usually in an unfavorable direction.)
 
Part II (Chapters 4-{}6, which we just finished) can be viewed as a logical progression from the uncertainty of developing a novel \hyperlink{product-mgmt-chap}{product}, to the day to day \hyperlink{work-management}{work} of building its features, to its predictable \hyperlink{ops-mgmt}{operation}. The "predictability curve" illustrated in the associated figure increases as the digital product stabilizes and moves to a fully operational state.
 
This question of predictability, of \textbf{the degree to which actuals track estimates} and can be known in advance, will be an ongoing theme throughout Part III. As we scale up, our organization takes on more and more work of all kinds, from highly uncertain to very predictable. Understanding the differences in this "portfolio" of work is essential to managing it correctly. There has always been an element of risk; as a startup, your success was not guaranteed! You now find that you are managing different classes of risk simultaneously, and "one size fits all" approaches do not work.
 
You might have a program to upgrade the memory on 80,000 identical Point of Sale terminals across 2,000 retail stores. It's going to take a lot of work; you'll be "rolling trucks" in all 50 states! But you are sure that you can estimate this work with a high degree of accuracy; it has high predictability. In terms of the  \hyperlink{cynefin}{Cynefin} framework (see sidebar), it's an obvious problem. On the other hand, creating a completely new Point of Sale system for your stores is an unpredictable effort. Your original estimate for this large program might be off by orders of magnitude. Its predictability is low. It's a complex problem.
 
Or perhaps you are writing reports using a well understood database and reporting tool. This work will be likely more predictable work\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}even if complicated in the Cynefin sense\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}as compared to developing the first few stories on a completely new architecture. This is true even if the estimated size of the work is the same for both the reports and the new stories. As a dimension, variability is \textbf{independent of the size of the work} (although the two may be correlated).
