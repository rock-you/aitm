\subsection{Conclusion}
\label{_conclusion_5}\hyperlabel{_conclusion_5}%
  
While operations management is an integral part of "DevOps," and of a given product's management, it is still a distinct area of concern and practice. The focus on interrupt-{}driven work results in different personality types being attracted to it, and different management approaches required.
 
Operations management has a broader industry meaning, but in the narrower IT sense, includes concerns of monitoring, state and configuration management, capacity and performance concerns, and related topics.
 
\subsubsection{Discussion questions}
\label{_discussion_questions_6}\hyperlabel{_discussion_questions_6}%
  \begin{itemize}

\item{} What experiences have you had where operational execution made the difference (either good or bad?) E.g. systems down, bad customer service? Good service?
 

\item{} Have you or anyone you've known worked in a call center or operations center? What was it like?
 

\item{} Do you prefer interrupt-{}driven or focused development work?
 

\item{} Read \href{http://perfcap.blogspot.com/2012/03/ops-devops-and-noops-at-netflix.html}{Ops, DevOps and PaaS (NoOps) at Netflix} and \href{https://gist.github.com/jallspaw/2140086}{Allspaw's response}. Discuss as a team.
 

\item{} What do you think of the concept of an "error budget" (like Google has) rather than just insisting that all systems should be up as much as possible?
 
\end{itemize}
  
\subsubsection{Research \& practice}
\label{_research_practice_6}\hyperlabel{_research_practice_6}%
  \begin{itemize}

\item{} Stand up two VMs, one with a web server, the other with Nagios or another open-{}source monitoring tool. Experiment with using Nagios to monitor various aspects of the web server.
 

\item{} Define customer application-{}level monitoring and test that it operates
 

\item{} Integrate a monitoring system such as Nagios with an IT service management tool such as iTOP, so that certain events auto-{}create Incident tickets.
 

\item{} In a team kanban setting, experiment with both user stories and operations requests coming into the same board or product team. What issues arise? How can you best handle the diversity of work? What if there were 10 times as much, what would you do?
 
\end{itemize}
