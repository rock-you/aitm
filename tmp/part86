coordination (n.)  co-{}ordination, c. 1600, "orderly combination," from French coordination (14c.) or directly from Late Latin coordinationem (nominative coordinatio), noun of action from past participle stem of Latin coordinare "to set in order, arrange," from com-{} "together" (see com-{}) + ordinatio "arrangement," from ordo "row, rank, series, arrangement" (see order (n.)). Meaning "action of setting in order" is from 1640s; that of "harmonious adjustment or action," especially of muscles and bodily movements, is from 1855.

Agile software development methods were particularly designed to deal with change and uncertainty, yet they de-{}emphasize traditional coordination mechanisms such as forward planning, extensive documentation, specific coordination roles, contracts, and strict adherence to a pre-{}specified process \hyperlink{Strode2012}{[Strode2012]}.

Growth is presenting us with many challenges. But we can't stop too long and think about how to handle it. We have to continue executing, as we scale up. The problem is like changing the tires on a moving car. It's not easy.
 
We've been executing since our first day in the garage. As noted \hyperlink{demand-supply-execute}{above}, execution is whenever we meet demand with supply. An idea for a new feature is demand. The time we spend implementing it is supply. The combination of the two is execution. Sometimes it goes well, sometimes it doesn't. Maintaining a tight \hyperlink{feedback}{feedback}  loop to continually assess our execution is essential.
 
As we grow into multiple teams and multiple products, we have more complex execution problems, requiring coordination. The fundamental problem is the "D-{}word:" \emph{dependency}. Dependencies are why we coordinate (work with no dependencies can scale nicely along the \hyperlink{AKF-cube}{AKF x-{}axis}.) But when we have dependencies (and there are various kinds) we need a wider range of techniques. Our one \hyperlink{card-wall}{Kanban board} is not sufficient to the task.
 
We need to consider the \hyperlink{delivery-models}{delivery models}, as well (the "3 Ps": product, project, process, and now we've added program management.) Decades of industry practice mean that people will tend to think in terms of these models and unless we are clear in our discussions about the nature of our work we can easily get pulled into non-{}value-{}adding arguments. To help our understanding, we'll take a deeper look at process management, continuous improvement, and their challenges.

\textbf{Instructor's note on learning progression}


The structure of Part III may be counter-{}intuitive. Usually, we think in terms of "plan, then execute." However, this can lead to waterfall and deterministic assumptions. Starting the discussion with execution reflects the fact that a scaling company does not have time to "stop and plan." Rather, planning \hyperlink{emergence-model}{emerges} on top of the ongoing execution of the firm, in the interest of controlling and directing that execution across broader time frames and larger scopes of work.
