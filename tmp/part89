\subsection{Why process management?}

Is a firm a collection of activities or a set of resources and capabilities? Clearly, a firm is both. But activities are what firms do, and they define the resources and capabilities that are relevant.

\end{quote}
 
\href{http://www.dictionary.com/browse/process}{Dictionary.com} defines process as "a systematic series of actions directed to some end . . . a continuous action, operation, or series of changes taking place in a definite manner." We saw the concept of "process" start to \hyperlink{process-mgmt-emerges}{emerge in Chapter 5}, as work become more specialized and repeatable and our card walls got more complicated.
 
We've discussed \hyperlink{work-management}{work management}, which is an important precursor of process management. Work management is less formalized; a wide variety of activities are handled through flexible \hyperlink{kanban}{Kanban}-{}style boards or "card walls" based on the simplest "process" of:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} To do
 

\item{} Doing
 

\item{} Done
 
\end{itemize}
 
However, the simple card wall/Kanban board can easily become much more complex, with the addition of swimlanes and additional columns, including holding areas for blocked work. As we discussed in Chapter 5, when tasks become more routine, repeatable, and specialized, formal \hyperlink{process-mgmt-emerges}{process management starts to emerge}. Process management starts with the fundamental capability for coordinated \hyperlink{work-management}{work management}, and refines it much further.
 
Process, in terms of "business process," has been a topic of study and field for professional development for many years. Pioneering Business Process Management (BPM) authors such as Michael Hammer \hyperlink{Hammer1993}{[Hammer1993]} and Geary Rummler \hyperlink{Rummler1995}{[Rummler1995]} have had an immense impact on business operations. Toyota considers a clear process vision, or "target condition," to be the most fundamental objective in improving operations (\hyperlink{Rother2010}{[Rother2010]}, chapters 5-{}6).  Designing processes, improving them, and using them to improve overall performance is an ongoing activity in most, if not all organizations.
 
In your company, work has been specializing. A simple card-{}based kanban approach is no longer sufficient. You are finding that some work is repetitive, and you need to remember to do certain things in certain orders. For example, a new Human Resources (HR) manager was hired, and decided that a sticky note of "hire someone new for us" was not sufficient. As she pointed out to the team, hiring employees was a regulated activity, with legal liability, requiring confidentiality, that needed to follow a defined sequence of tasks:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Establishing the need and purpose for the position
 

\item{} Soliciting candidates
 

\item{} Filtering the candidates
 

\item{} Selecting a final choice
 

\item{} Registering that new employee in the payroll system
 

\item{} Getting the new employee set up with benefits providers (insurance, retirement, etc)
 

\item{} Getting the new employee working space, equipment, and access to systems
 

\item{} Training the new employee in organizational policies, as well as any position-{}specific orientation
 
\end{itemize}
 
The sales, marketing, and finance teams have similarly been developing ordered lists of tasks that are consistently executed as end to end sequences. And even in the core digital development and operations teams, they are finding that \hyperlink{IT-process-emergence}{some tasks are repetitive} and need documentation so they are performed consistently.
 
Your entire digital product \hyperlink{pipeline}{pipeline} is sometimes called a "process." From initial feature idea through production, you seek a consistent means for identifying and implementing valuable functionality. Sometimes this work requires intensive, iterative collaboration and is unpredictable (e.g. developing a user interface); sometimes, the work is more repeatable (e.g. packaging and releasing tested functionality).
 
You're hiring more specialized people with specialized backgrounds. Many of them enter your organization and immediately ask process questions:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} What's your Security process?
 

\item{} What's your Architecture process?
 

\item{} What's your Portfolio process?
 
\end{itemize}
 
You've not had these conversations before. What do they mean by these different "processes?" They seem to have some expectation from their previous employment, and if you say "we don't have one" they tend to be confused. You're becoming concerned that your company may be running some risk, although you also are wary that "process" might mean slowing things down, and you can't afford that.
 
However, some team members are cautious of the word "process". The term "process police" comes up in an unhappy way.
 
"Are we going to have auditors tracking whether we filled out all our forms correctly?," one asks.
 
"We used to get these consultants in at my old company and they would leave piles of 3 ring binders on the shelf that no one ever looked at," another person says.
 
"I can't write code according to someone's recipe!," a third says with some passion, and to general agreement from the developers in the room.
 
The irony is that digital products are based on process automation. The idea that certain tasks can be done repeatably and at scale through digitization is fundamental to all use of computers. The digital service \textbf{is} fundamentally an automated process, one that can be intricate and complicated. That's what computers do. But process management also spans human activities, and that's where things get more complex.
 
Processes are how we ensure consistency, repeatability, and quality. You get expected treatment at banks, coffee shops, and dentists because they follow processes. IT systems often enable processes \textendash{} a mortgage origination system is based on IT software that enforces a consistent process. IT management itself follows certain processes, for all the same reasons as above.
 
However, process can cause problems. Like project management, the practice of process management is under scrutiny in the new Lean and Agile-{}influenced digital world. Processes imply \hyperlink{queuing}{queues}, and in digital and other product development-{}based organizations, this means invisible work in process. For every employee you hire who expects you to have processes, another will have bad process experiences at previous employers. Nevertheless, process remains an important tool in your toolkit for organization design.
 
Process is a broad concept used throughout business operations. \textbf{The coverage here is primarily about process as applied to the digital organization.} There is a bit of a recursive paradox here; in part, we are talking about the \textbf{process by which business processes are analyzed and sometimes automated}. By definition, this overall "process" (you could call it a \textbf{meta}-{}process) cannot be made too prescriptive or predictable.
 
The concept of "process" is important and will persist through digital transformation. We need a robust set of tools to discuss it. This chapter will break the problem into a lifecycle of:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Process conception
 

\item{} Process content
 

\item{} Process execution
 

\item{} Process improvement
 
\end{itemize}
 
Although we don't preface these topics with "Agile" or "Lean," bringing those and related perspectives to these ideas is the intent of this chapter.
 
\subsubsection{Process conception}
\label{_process_conception}\hyperlabel{_process_conception}%
  \begin{quote}

"Many companies have at least one dysfunctional area. This may be the \textquotedblleft{}furniture police\textquotedblright{} who won't let programmers rearrange furniture to facilitate pair programming. Or it may be a purchasing group that takes six weeks to process a standard software order. In any event these types of insanity get in the way of successful projects."

\hspace*\fill--- Mike Cohn
\emph{Succeeding with Agile: Software Development Using Scrum} \end{quote}
 
Processes can generate various emotional reactions:
 
"Dysfunctional! Insanity!" (as above)
 
"Follow the process!"
 
"What bureaucracy!"
 
"Don't create a 'Process Police'!"
 
"I am an IT Service Management professional. I believe in the ITIL framework!"
 
"I don't write code on an assembly line!"
 
Such reactions are commonplace in social media, but we need a more objective and rational approach to understand the pros and cons of processes. We have seen a number of neutral concepts towards this end from authors such as Don Reinertsen and Diane Strode:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} \hyperlink{queuing}{Queues}
 

\item{} \hyperlink{strode-dependency-taxonomy}{Dependencies}
 

\item{} \hyperlink{coord-tools}{Coordination}
 

\item{} \hyperlink{queuing}{Queues}
 

\item{} \hyperlink{synchronization}{Cadence and Synchronization}
 

\item{} \hyperlink{checklist-manifesto}{Sequencing}
 
\end{itemize}
 
A process is a technique, a tool, and no technique should be implemented without a thorough understanding of the organizational context. Nor should any technique be implemented without rigorous, disciplined follow-{}up as to its real effects, both direct and indirect. Many of the issues with process comes from a cultural failure to seek understanding of the organization needs in objective terms such as these. We'll think about this cultural failure more in the Chapter 9 discussion of \hyperlink{Toyota-Kata}{Toyota Kata}.
 
A skeptical and self-{}critical, "go and see" approach is therefore essential. Too often, processes are instituted in reaction to the last problem, imposed top down, and rarely evaluated for effectiveness. Allowing affected parties to lead a process re-{}design is a core Lean principle (kaizen). On the other hand, uncoordinated local control of processes can also have destructive effects, as the next section discusses:
 
\paragraph{The pitfall of process "silos"}
\label{_the_pitfall_of_process_silos}\hyperlabel{_the_pitfall_of_process_silos}%
  \begin{quote}

One organization enthusiastically embraced process improvement, with good reason: customers, suppliers, and employees found the company's processes slow, inconsistent, and error prone. Unfortunately, they were so enthusiastic that each team defined the work of their small group or department as a complete process. Of course, each of these was in fact the contribution of a specialized functional group to some larger, but unidentified, processes. Each of these "processes" was "improved" independently, and you can guess what happened.  Within the boundaries of each process, improvements were implemented that made work more efficient from the perspective of the performer. However, these mini-{}processes were efficient largely because they had front-{}end constraints that made work easier for the performer but imposed a burden on the customer or the preceding process. The attendant delay and effort meant that the true business processes behaved even more poorly than they had before. This is a common outcome when processes are defined too "small." Moral: Don't confuse subprocesses or activities with business processes.

\emph{Workflow Modeling} \end{quote}
 
The above quote (from \hyperlink{Sharp2009}{[Sharp2009]}) well illustrates the dangers of combining local optimization and  process management. Many current authors speak highly of self-{}organizing teams, but self-{}organizing teams may seek to optimize locally. Process management was originally intended to overcome this problem, but modeling techniques can be applied at various levels, including within specific departments. This is where enterprise business architecture can assist, by identifying these longer, end to end flows of value and highlighting the handoff areas, so that the process benefits the larger objective.
  
\paragraph{Process proliferation}
\label{_process_proliferation}\hyperlabel{_process_proliferation}%
  
Another pitfall we cover here is that of process proliferation. Process is a powerful tool. Ultimately it is how value is delivered. However, too many processes can have negative results on an organization. One thing often overlooked in process management and process frameworks is any attention to the resource impacts of the process. This is a primary difference between project and process management; in process management (both theory and frameworks), resource availability is in general assumed.
 
More advanced forms of process modeling and simulation (see " \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=discrete+event+simulation}{discrete event simulation})" can provide insight into the resource demands for processes. However, such techniques 1) require specialized tooling and 2) are not part of the typical BPM practitioner's skillset.
 
Many enterprise environments have multiple cross-{}functional processes:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} service requests,
 

\item{} compliance certifications,
 

\item{} asset validations,
 

\item{} provisioning requests,
 

\item{} capacity assessments,
 

\item{} change approvals,
 

\item{} training obligations,
 

\item{} performance assessments,
 

\item{} audit responses,
 

\item{} expense reporting,
 

\item{} travel approvals,
 
\end{itemize}
 
and many more. Such processes can be implemented on the assumption that enterprises can always accommodate another process. The result can be dramatic overburden for digital staff in complex environments. It is therefore advisable to at least keep an inventory of processes that may impose demand on staff, and understand both the aggregate demand as well as the degree of \hyperlink{multi-tasking}{multi-{}tasking and context-{}switching} that may result (as discussed in Chapter 5). Thorough automation of all processes to the maximum extent possible can also drive value, as both load and distraction are reduced.
   
\subsubsection{Process execution}
\label{_process_execution}\hyperlabel{_process_execution}%
  
Since our initial discussions in Chapter 5 on Work Management, we find ourselves returning full circle. Despite the various ways in which work is conceived, funded, and formulated, at the end "it's all just work." The digital organization must retain concern for the "human resources" (that is, people) who find themselves at the mercy of:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} project fractional allocations driving multi-{}tasking
 

\item{} processes imposed top down with no demand analysis or evaluation of benefits
 

\item{} myriad demands that, although critical, do not seem to fit into either of the first two categories
 
\end{itemize}
 
The Lean movement manages through minimizing waste and over-{}processing. This means both taking out un-{}necessary steps from processes, \textbf{AND eliminating un-{}necessary processes completely when required}. Correspondingly, the processes that remain should have high levels of visibility. They should be taken with the utmost seriousness, and their status should be central to most people's awareness. (This is the purpose of \hyperlink{andon}{Andon}.)
 
\paragraph{From workflow tools to collaboration and digital exhaust}
\label{_from_workflow_tools_to_collaboration_and_digital_exhaust}\hyperlabel{_from_workflow_tools_to_collaboration_and_digital_exhaust}%
  
One reason process tends to generate friction and be unpopular is the poor usability of workflow tools. Older tools tend to present myriads of data fields to the user and expect a high degree of training. Each state change in the process is supposed to be logged and tracked by having someone sign in to the tool and update status manually.
 
By contrast, modern workflow approaches take full advantage of mobile platforms and integration with technology like chat rooms. Mobile development imposes higher standards for user experience (UX) design, which makes tracking workflow somewhat easier. Integrated software pipelines that integrate application lifecycle management and/or project management with source code and build management are increasingly gaining favor. For example:
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} A user logs a new feature request in the Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) tool
 

\item{} When the request is assigned to a developer, the tool automatically creates a feature branch in the source control system for the developer to work on
 

\item{} The developer writes tests and associated code that merge changes back to the central repository once tests are passed successfully
 

\item{} The system automatically runs build tests
 

\item{} The ALM tool is automatically updated accordingly with completion if all tests pass
 
\end{enumerate}
 
See also the previous discussion of \hyperlink{ChatOps}{ChatOps}, which similarly combines communication and execution in a low-{}friction manner, while providing rich digital exhaust as an audit trail.
 
In general, the idea is that we can understand digital processes not through painful manual status updates, but rather through their digital exhaust -{} the data byproducts of people performing the value-{}add day to day work, at speed and with flow instead of constant delays for approvals and status updates.

\subsubsection{Measuring process}
\label{_measuring_process}\hyperlabel{_measuring_process}%
  
One of the most important reasons for repeatable processes is so that they can be measured and understood. Repeatable processes are measured in terms of:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Speed
 

\item{} Effort
 

\item{} Quality
 

\item{} Variation
 

\item{} Outcomes
 
\end{itemize}
 
at the most general level, and of course all of those measurements must be defined much more specifically depending on the process. Operations (often in the form of business processes) generate data, and data can be aggregated and reported on. Such reporting serves as a form of feedback for management, and even governance. Examples of metrics might include:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Quarterly sales as a dollar amount
 

\item{} Percentage of time a service or system is available
 

\item{} Number of successful releases or pushes of code (new functionality)
 
\end{itemize}
 
Measurement is an essential aspect of process management, but must be carefully designed. Measuring process can have unforeseen results. Process participants will behave according to how the process is measured. If a help desk operator is measured and rated on how many calls they process an hour, the quality of those interactions may suffer. It is critical that any process "key performance indicator" be understood in terms of the highest possible business objectives. Is the objective truly to process as many calls as possible? Or is it to satisfy the customer so they need not turn to other channels to get their answers?
 
A variety of terms and practices exist in process metrics and measurement, such as:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} The Balanced Scorecard
 

\item{} The concept of a metrics hierarchy
 

\item{} Leading versus lagging indicators
 
\end{itemize}
 
\paragraph{Balanced Scorecard}
\label{_balanced_scorecard}\hyperlabel{_balanced_scorecard}%
  
The balanced score card is a commonly-{}seen approach for measuring and managing organizations. First proposed by Kaplan and Norton \hyperlink{Kaplan1992}{[Kaplan1992]} in the Harvard Business Review, the Balanced Scorecard groups metrics into the following subject areas:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Financial
 

\item{} Customer
 

\item{} Internal business processes
 

\item{} Learning and growth
 
\end{itemize}
  
\paragraph{Metrics Hierarchy}
\label{_metrics_hierarchy}\hyperlabel{_metrics_hierarchy}%
  
Metrics can be seen as "lower" versus "higher" level. For example, the metrics from a particular product might be aggregated with the metrics from all products, to provide an overall metric of product success.
  
\paragraph{Leading \& Lagging Indicators}
\label{_leading_lagging_indicators}\hyperlabel{_leading_lagging_indicators}%
  
Metrics can indicate past performance (lagging), or predict future performance (leading).
   
\subsubsection{Process improvement}
\label{_process_improvement}\hyperlabel{_process_improvement}%
  \begin{quote}

There tended to be no big picture waiting to be revealed . . . there was only process kaizen . . . focused on isolated individual steps. . . . We coined the term \textquotedblleft{}kamikaze kaizen\textquotedblright{} . . . to describe the likely result: lots of commotion, many isolated victories . . . [and] loss of the war when no sustainable benefits reached the customer or the bottom line.

\hspace*\fill--- Womack and Jones
\emph{Lean Thinking} \end{quote}
 
Once processes are measured, the natural desire is to use the measurements to improve them. But dysfunction and antipatterns exist here:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Not basing process improvement in an empirical understanding of the situation
 

\item{} Process improvement activities that do not involve those affected
 

\item{} Not treating process activities as demand in and of themselves
 

\item{} Uncoordinated improvement activities, far from the bottom line
 
\end{itemize}
 
The solutions are to be found largely within Lean theory.
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Understand the facts of the process; do not pretend to understand based on remote reports. "Go and see," in other words.
 

\item{} Respect people, and understand that best understanding of the situation is held by those closest to it.
 

\item{} Make time and resources available for improvement activities. For example, assign them a Problem ticket and ensure there are resources specifically tasked with working it, who are given relief from other duties.
 

\item{} Periodically review improvement activities as part of the overall portfolio. You are placing "bets" on them just as with new features. Do they merit your investment?
 
\end{itemize}
 
In the next section, we'll look at some of the history and theory behind continuous improvement.
