In thinking about how organizations develop as they scale, it is helpful to consider various time frames:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Ongoing execution is the actual day to day work, however conceived. At this point in our journey, the work includes a significant challenge of coordination (which we define and analyze in Chapter 7). It can include defined process activities, project deliverables, the flow of new product functionality, or ongoing improvement and governance. Ongoing execution is the "moment of truth" where estimate becomes actual and supply meets demand, and in our environment is now a complex matter.
 

\item{} Investment decisions are required to charter programs, products, features, and components, even in those companies that may be moving away from a traditional project cycle. Investments are usually understood in terms of budget planning, which traditionally has driven the project funding cycle. They represent some statement of intent for a larger scope of work to be performed and/or sustained, based on the organizational platform, which should be able to support multiple investments.
 

\item{} Organizational changes may take years, and require considerable effort and thought if they are to succeed. One does not change organizational structures lightly or (hopefully) frequently.  Employee tenure is in general even longer.
 

\item{} Culture takes longest and is most difficult to change; it easily outlasts both organizational forms and even individual employees coming and going. Both culture and organization have self-{}reinforcing \hyperlink{feedback}{feedback} loops which add complexity to any deliberate attempts to transform them.
 
\end{itemize}
