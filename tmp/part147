About the same time as the CMM's initial creation and transition to the Software Engineering Institute, the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency of the United Kingdom recognized that IT practices were becoming fragmented. In response, a multi-{}volume set of guidance known as the IT Infrastructure Library was created. A 2nd edition consolidated and updated this guidance, and achieved worldwide acceptance as a de facto standard for IT management. The term "service" was inserted, i.e. "IT Service Management" but the distinction between the ITSM term and simple "IT Management" has always been unclear. Due to the particular structure of UK government publications, ITIL has never covered project management or the SDLC per se, or analysis, architecture and design.
 
ITIL is currently published via the Axelos commercial joint venture between the UK government and Capita Group. It is now in its 4th major edition (2011). While often considered an \textquotedblleft{}operational\textquotedblright{} framework, ITIL spans the lifecycle of IT services and systems; the current volumes reflect a lifecycle:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Service Strategy
 

\item{} Service Design
 

\item{} Service Transition
 

\item{} Service Operations
 

\item{} Continual Service Improvement
 
\end{itemize}
 
Within these volumes, ITIL defines a number of activities, functions, and what it calls processes (more on this below). These definitions have helped stabilize industry practice and provided a basis for industry training and certification of individuals.
 
ITIL's processes include:
