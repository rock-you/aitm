\section{Emergence means formalization}
\label{_emergence_means_formalization}\hyperlabel{_emergence_means_formalization}%
  
The emergence model seeks to define a likely order in which concerns are \textbf{formalized}. Any concern may of course arise at any time\textemdash{}the startup founder certainly is concerned with security! Formalization means at least one or more of the following:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Dedicated resources
 

\item{} Dedicated organization
 

\item{} Defined policies and processes
 

\item{} Automated tooling
 
\end{itemize}
 
In the author's experience, for example, startups avoid formalized process and project management. To the extent the concerns exist, they are \emph{tacit} (understood or implied; suggested; implicit). Certainly, a small startup does not invest in an enterprise-{}class service desk tool supporting a full array of IT management processes or a full-{}blown project management office with its own vice president and associated portfolio automation. Simple work management, with a manual or automated Kanban board, is likely their choice for work management.
 
But by the time they are a team of teams, specialization has emerged and more robust processes and tools are required. Finally, the more complex, enterprise-{}scale concerns at the end of the book are presented as part of a logical progression.
 
The danger of course is that the formalization effort may be driven by its own logic and start to lose track of the all-{}critical business context. By carefully examining these stages of maturation, and the industry responses to them, it is the author's hope that the student will have effective tools to critically engage with the problem of scaling the digital organization.
