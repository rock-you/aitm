At this writing, there is much debate on how to unify the value and insights of team-{}based Agile development, with the coordination and governance needs of the large enterprise. Thinking in terms of:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Governance
 

\item{} Information
 

\item{} Architecture
 
\end{itemize}
 
is recommended as the enterprise digital experience requires their formalization. But it is critical to not lose track of the product vision and value you started with at the outset of our emergence journey. Without fast feedback enabling responsive digital services for the customer, none of the rest of it matters.
 
Congratulations, and thank you for persisting through this work.
