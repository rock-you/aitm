\subsection{The delivery models}
\label{_the_delivery_models}\hyperlabel{_the_delivery_models}%
  
In Chapter 4 we introduced the \hyperlink{process-project-product}{"3 Ps"}:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Product management
 

\item{} Project management
 

\item{} Process management
 
\end{itemize}
 
It is important that you review them. Sometimes, the concept of "program" is also used. We will call these delivery models: they are organizing paradigms for getting work done. They may depend on each other, but they each have clear industry identity and bodies of knowledge associated with them:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Product management has the Product Development and Marketing association and authors like Steve Blank and Marty Cagan.
 

\item{} Program management has the Axelos Managing Successful Programmes guidance
 

\item{} Project management has the Project Management Body of Knowledge and the PRINCE2 guidance from Axelos.
 

\item{} Process management has the BPMN and BPEL standards and authors like Geary Rummler, Roger Burlton and Paul Harmon.
 
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Product versus program management}


Program management is a term seen in government efforts and military contracting to describe major efforts of uncertain duration and (sometimes) uncertain outcome. Product management is also uncertain of duration and outcome, and the industry does not clearly distinguish between the two. Some companies use concepts of both product and program management; others use one or the other. Stanley Portny describes:

\emph{Program: This term can describe two different situations. First, a program can be a set of goals that gives rise to specific projects, but, unlike a project, a program can never be completely accomplished. For example, a health-{}awareness program can never completely achieve its goal (the public will never be totally aware of all health issues as a result of a health-{}awareness program), but one or more projects may accomplish specific results related to the program's goal (such as a workshop on minimizing the risk of heart disease). Second, a program sometimes refers to a group of specified projects that achieve a common goal} \hyperlink{Portny2013}{[Portny2013]}.

Where both terms are used, program management may be more about delivery and execution (shading into project management's domain), while product management is more about vision and outcome.
\end{sidebar}
 
We order the delivery models by their \emph{variability}. What does that mean? Products and programs have the highest variability. Their outcome may differ considerably from the initial vision that drove them. Projects, in theory, should be reasonably plannable\hspace{0.167em}\textemdash{}\hspace{0.167em}their schedule and cost are managed in terms of "plan versus actual" and differences, ideally, should be well controlled and understandable. Finally, process management strives to minimize variation and in its most rigorous form uses statistical control to do so. If we matrix the delivery models with the time frames we get:

\end{center}
\caption{Time frame matrixed to delivery}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
The relationships between the timeframes and delivery models are complex:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Investments are made in products first, which may or may not need projects and/or processes. Rigorous planned projects or detailed, repeatable processes are not, in fact, optimal for product discovery -{} a mistake the digital industry has fallen into over and over again.
 

\item{} Products are best thought of in terms of discovery and empirical hypothesis-{}testing. If the hypothesis fails, the investment should be cancelled. So, the "product" concept is both shorter and longer lived than the average project, which is typically understood on an annual cycle.
 

\item{} Project management also may take place without processes, as it may be based on one-{}time "deliverables" that are not repeatedly produced.
 

\item{} To support a process requires portfolio investment and organizational structure, but no project may ever be involved. Whether a product is implied by the existence of a process is an interesting question we will think about.
 
\end{itemize}
 
Clearly, we must think carefully about the relationships between these dimensions. That, in a nutshell, is the purpose of part III.

\textbf{Instructor's note}


We are inverting the usual plan-{}execute order on purpose, starting with execution and expanding from there. This inversion challenges the too-{}common assumption of "plan, then execute" (alternatively seen as "plan-{}build-{}run".) We discuss longer-{}horizon planning after we discuss execution, because we must keep execution alive at all costs and cannot afford to shut it down while we go off and make plans for our new larger scale.

The demand-{}supply-{}execute model's origins and thought process can be seen in a series of 4 blog posts starting with \href{http://www.lean4it.com/2014/05/from-planbuildrun-to-demandsupplyexecute.html}{http://www.lean4it.com/\-2014/\-05/\-from-{}planbuildrun-{}to-{}demandsupplyexecute.html}.
