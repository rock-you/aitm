\subsection{Process and related terms}
\label{_process_and_related_terms}\hyperlabel{_process_and_related_terms}%
  
The following terms often appear in discussions of process:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Function
 

\item{} Capability
 

\item{} Practice
 
\end{itemize}
 
We will use the following definitions:
 
\label{process-def}\hyperlabel{process-def} A \textbf{process} is an ordered, countable set of activities; an event-{}driven, value-{}adding sequence that can be measured and improved. The following terms often are used to describe processes or their components:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Value chain
 

\item{} Value stream
 

\item{} Business process
 

\item{} Workflow
 

\item{} Procedure
 

\item{} Task
 

\item{} Step
 
\end{itemize}
 
Processes \textbf{cross} functions.
 
Visually, processes are often represented with chevrons, like Porter's original value chain:
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\end{center}
\caption{Chevrons}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
There is no industry standard that definitely lists the concepts above in terms of granularity. Is a "task" larger or smaller than a "procedure?" We will not discuss these much. However, between the high level concept of "value chain" and the concepts of "process" and "activity," is the concept of "\textbf{value stream}."  This is a key concept from the Lean community, and is a relatively higher-{}level concept (a value chain decomposes into value streams, according to some.)
 
An example of a value stream could be the complete manufacturing and sales process for one product family. Because they are more specific, value streams are more measurable and countable. Optimizing them in terms of eliminating wasted time, effort and inventory is an objective of Lean thinking. See \emph{Learning to See} by Rother and Shook \hyperlink{Rother2003}{[Rother2003]}.
 
\textbf{Functions} are unordered, steady state domains of activity. An organizational chart often can be based on various functions. Functions also often imply hierarchy. They are more difficult to measure or improve; usually, improving a function means improving some process it owns or performs.
 
Functions, especially when they are closely aligned to an organizational structure, may be represented as a hierarchy:
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/3_09-hier.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/3_09-hier.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/3_09-hier.png}}}}{functional hierarchy}
\end{center}
\caption{Functional hierarchy}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
They may also be represented as nested shapes:
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/3_09-hier-nested.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/3_09-hier-nested.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/3_09-hier-nested.png}}}}{nested functions}
\end{center}
\caption{Nested functions}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
However -{} and this is an important point -{} functions do \textbf{not} necessarily need to reflect the organizational chart. Often, they are used as a "logical" construct, to help with organizational design.
 
What do we mean by this?
 
Suppose two companies merge. They may leave their organizational charts untouched for a time, because they do not know what parts of each company should merge together. They have two sets of developers, two sets of sales staff, and so on. They do not feel that either company's organizational structure is a good basis for the new, larger company.
 
To solve this, they might create a logical functional hierarchy, with no-{}one's name on any part. Where their actual organization structure (temporarily) has duplication, the logical hierarchy does not. They then start to populate it with individuals and teams from the previous companies and in this way develop a new organizational structure.
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\end{center}
\caption{Merging organizations}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
This kind of thinking can help the organization evolve over time. If different teams find themselves performing similar activities, a functional analysis might indicate a new organizational structure.
 
Finally, the following two terms are also unordered, but have different connotations from function:
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Capability
 

\item{} Service (sometimes)
 
\end{itemize}
 
A \textbf{capability} is a generic term for a capacity or potential.
 
A \textbf{service} is a transactional act of value, simultaneously produced and delivered (more on this later).
 
Finally, the concept of \textbf{practice} is the least formalized of the concepts. It represents a loose, conceptual area that may represent a community of common interest (for example, a Java community of practice). It's not usually measured or tracked for improvement. Some topics may start as a practice and formalize into a function, for example Capacity management.
 
Review the section on the \hyperlink{spotify-model}{Spotify model}. How does it relate to the discussion here?
 
We say that an IT management capability may be implemented by a process, function, or practice.
 
Processes cross functions in a repeatable way. You may have deep organizational functions such as
 \begin{itemize}

\item{} Human Resource Management
 

\item{} Facilities Management
 

\item{} IT Asset Management
 

\item{} Security Management
 

\item{} Network Management
 
\end{itemize}
 
However, you have a value adding activity of bringing in a new employee that involved ALL of these functions:
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/5_04-ProcXFunc.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/5_04-ProcXFunc.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/5_04-ProcXFunc.png}}}}{processes crossing functions}
\end{center}
\caption{Process crossing functions}
\end{wrapfigure}
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} The HR department enters the employee in the HR system (including payroll).
 

\item{} Either the HR department or the hiring manager requests space from Facilities Management.
 

\item{} A workstation and smart phone are requested from IT Asset Management
 

\item{} When those devices are received, Security authorizes them (and the employee) to enterprise systems (critically the enterprise directory)
 

\item{} If a wired connection is needed, Network Management may be required to "turn  on" a port in the employee's location.
 
\end{enumerate}
 
This is a deliberately older, traditional workflow. Modern organizations may accelerate things:
 \begin{enumerate}[label=\arabic*.]

\item{} HR enters a record
 

\item{} All employees use common "hoteling" space, so the major Facilities concern is whether the space can accommodate the peak \# of employees seen (e.g. at 10 AM on a Wednesday)
 

\item{} Equipment is either BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) or is ordered from an authorized vendor and drop-{}shipped directly to the employee
 

\item{} In either case, security must establish some control over the devices, so that organizational data remains secure. There are various approaches for this, even for devices owned by the employee.
 

\item{} Networking in modern organizations is almost all wireless, but the employee still requires the appropriate credentials, likely provided by security. As with facilities, networking's concerns now move to questions of capacity and availability of the overall infrastructure.
 
\end{enumerate}
 
Notice however that even in the modern scenario, we have an end to end, repeatable value flow that crosses distinct domains of concern. The employee is not productive until all these steps are taken. Since the employee starts drawing payroll on hire, there is a substantial cost of delay for this entire process. A week's unproductive time could amount to \$10,000 or more, wasted.
 
Such delays can easily happen when functional areas are focused just on their responsibility, and no one is concerned for the overall process. This is why Rummler and Brache chose the title \emph{Improving Performance: How to Manage the White Space on the Organization Chart} for their groundbreaking book on business process. The "white space" they are talking about is the spaces between the functions, also termed "silos" or "towers:"
 \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}

\begin{center}
\imgexists{images/5_04-PXFNamed.png}{{\imgevalsize{images/5_04-PXFNamed.png}{\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{images/5_04-PXFNamed.png}}}}{cross silo process}
\end{center}
\caption{Silos, white space, and cross-{}functional process}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
You may notice that the cross functional process is named with an active verb, "Onboard." This is in contrast to the functional silos, which end in "management." This is deliberate and a well-{}established BPM best practice. "Onboard employee" is event-{}driven and countable; it has a clear beginning and end and therefore can be measured in various ways. "Human Resource Management", on the other hand, has no beginning or end; it is a steady-{}state set of organizational concerns and resources.
 \begin{DBKadmonition}{warning}{Important}
 
The idea that processes are active and countable, while functions are passive and ongoing, is critical to effective organizational design and performance management.
 \end{DBKadmonition}
 
Finally, context is everything. Notice that this end to end process of "onboard employee" belongs to the overall supporting activity of Human Resource Management in terms of the value chain we started with:

\end{center}
\caption{Process context}
\end{wrapfigure}
 
There is a rich variety of ways to think about enterprises and their operations at the largest scale. We will return to the question of process context and value chain in the chapter section on process frameworks. For now, we will move to a more detailed level of process modeling, now that we have introduced certain key concepts.
