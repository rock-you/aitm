<title>Praise for this book</title>
<simpara><emphasis>Agile IT Management is a perfect fit for my Management Information Systems class to introduce students to the fast-paced world of IT Infrastructure that they will be dealing with shortly upon graduation.  This book uses multiple perspectives (Founder, Team Leader, VP, C-level executive) to demonstrate to the student not only how a business grows, but how they need to continually grow their skill set.  The use of hands-on exercises encouraged by the format of this book complements my teaching style that allows students to learn by doing, failing and doing again.  An additional benefit is that this book begins with a focus on the startup mentality which I will use in my Business Innovation class.</emphasis></simpara>

<title>Preface</title>
<simpara>In 2013, I was approached by Dr. Bhabani Misra, the head of the Graduate Programs in Software at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. Dr. Misra asked me to teach an "IT Infrastructure" course (SEIS660), focusing on the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, or ITIL.</simpara>
<simpara>The first semester of the class was well received enough for me to be invited back. However, there were complaints from the students that it was too "theoretical." I was attempting to teach using an enterprise architecture style, with lots of abstractions, that just was not engaging students effectively.</simpara>
<simpara>I also had a team project approach that immediately started the students out as the IT leadership team of a large corporation. This generated feedback that the students wanted something more practical; they were not going to be immediately hired as senior executives!</simpara>
<simpara>I took this feedback seriously. I especially gave thought to a practical aspect, and so started to develop a lab component. This was and is popular with the students. I also started to think about different approaches for structuring the class that would make more sense for a survey class with a wide spectrum of experience.</simpara>
<simpara>For three semesters I assigned my first book (<emphasis>Architecture and Patterns for IT: Service Management, Resource Planning, and Governance</emphasis>) as a required text for the class. However, I did not write this as a textbook and its limitations became clearer and clearer. It has a strongly architectural approach, approaching the IT management problem as a series of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">views on a model</link>. I do not recommend this as a pedagogical approach for a survey class.</simpara>
<simpara>I approached my publisher with the idea of a 3rd edition that would pivot the existing material towards being something more useful in class. They agreed to this and I started the rewrite.</simpara>
<simpara>However, by the time I was halfway done with the first draft, I had a completely new book. Material from the previous work simply did not fit the emergence model used to structure the narrative.</simpara>
<simpara>A number of factors converged at this point:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>My view that the "medium is the message" and this extends to choice of authoring approach, intellectual property, DRM, and publisher</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Contacts with local and international faculty and thought leaders, and a desire to openly collaborate with them on making the book as good as possible</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A desire to freely share at least a rough version of the book, both for marketing purposes and in the interests of giving back to the global IT community</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A desire to be able to rapidly update the book with as little friction as possible</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A practical realization that the book might get more uptake globally if available at least in some form as free and open source IP</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The fact I had already started to <link xl:href="https://github.com/StThomas-SEIS660">publish my labs on Github</link>, and had in fact had developed a workable continuous delivery ("DevOps") toolchain (the <link xl:href="https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/Calavera">Calavera project</link>, which has attracted collaborators from the US, Spain, and Israel).</simpara>

<chapter xml:id="Introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>
<section xml:id="_for_the_student">
<title>For the student</title>
<simpara>This is a "survey" text intended for the advanced undergraduate or graduate student interested in the general field of applied IT management. It is grounded in basic computing fundamentals, but does not require any particular technical skills to understand. You do not need to have taken any courses in networking, security, or particular programming languages to read this book.</simpara>
<simpara>However, you will be presented with material on such topics, including fragments of programming languages and pseudocode, and need to be willing to invest the time and effort to understand.</simpara>
<simpara>This book makes frequent reference to digital startups - early stage companies bringing new  products to market that are primarily delivered as some form of computer-based service. Whether or not you intend to pursue such endeavors, the startup journey is a powerful one for your learning. Large information technology organizations in enterprises sometimes gain a reputation for losing sight of business value. IT seems to be acquired and operated for its own sake. Statements like "we need to align IT with the business!" are too often heard.</simpara>
<simpara>A digital startup exposes with great clarity the linkage between "IT" and "the business." The success or failure of the company itself depends on the adept and responsive creation and deployment of the software-based systems. Market revenues arrive, or do not, based on digital product strategy and the priorities chosen. Features the market doesn&#8217;t need? You won&#8217;t have the money to stay in business. Great features, but your product is unstable and unreliable? Your customers will go to the competition.</simpara>
<simpara>The lessons that digital entrepreneurs have learned through this trial by fire shed great light on IT&#8217;s value to the business. Thinking about a startup allows us to consider the most fundamental principles as a sort of microcosm, a small laboratory model of the same problems that the largest enterprises face.</simpara>
<simpara>However, this is not a textbook (or course) on entrepreneurship. It remains IT-centric. <emphasis role="strong">And, the book is also intended to be relevant to students entering directly into large, established enterprises.</emphasis> In fact, it prepares the student for working in all stages of growth because it progresses through these four contexts:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Individual (founder)</simpara>
</listitem>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Small company (team of teams)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Enterprise</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Whether in a startup, or on a journey within a larger, established organization, you will (hopefully) become aware as you progress through a broadening context:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Other team members</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Senior executives and funders</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Auditors and regulators</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Part of maturing in one&#8217;s career is understanding how all these relationships figure into your own overall system of value delivery. This will be a lifelong journey for the student; the author&#8217;s intent is to provide some useful tools.</simpara>

<title>Assumptions of the reader</title>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>This book is written at the advanced undergraduate/graduate student level. It is currently available only in English.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>There is no assumption of deep IT experience, but there is an assumption that the person interacts with computers in some capacity and has basic technical literacy. They should for example understand the concept of an "operating system." An A+ certification, or an intro to programming class for example, would more than adequately prepare someone for this book.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>A person completely unfamiliar with computing will need to supplement their reading as suggested throughout the text. There is a wealth of free and accurate information on IT fundamentals (e.g. compute, storage, networking, programming, etc) and this book seeks more to curate than replicate.</simpara>

<title>Emergence means formalization</title>
<simpara>The emergence model seeks to define a likely order in which concerns are <emphasis role="strong">formalized</emphasis>. Any concern may of course arise at any time: the startup founder certainly is concerned with security!</simpara>
<simpara>Formalization means at least one or more of the following:</simpara>

<simpara>Dedicated resources</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Dedicated organization</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Automated tooling</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>In the author&#8217;s experience, for example, startups avoid formalized process and project management. To the extent the concerns exist, they are <emphasis>tacit</emphasis> (understood or implied; suggested; implicit). Certainly, a small startup does not invest in an enterprise-class service desk tool supporting a full array of IT management processes, or a full-blown Project Management Office with its own Vice President and associated portfolio automation. Simple work management, with a manual or automated Kanban board, is likely their choice for work management.</simpara>
<simpara>But by the time they are a team of teams, specialization has emerged and more robust processes and tools are required. The danger of course is that the formalization effort may be driven by its own logic, and start to lose track of the all-critical business context.</simpara>
<simpara>By careful examining these stages of maturation, and the industry responses to them, it is the author&#8217;s hope that the student will have effective tools to critically engage with the problem of scaling the digital organization.</simpara>

<title>Part I: Founder</title>
<simpara><anchor xml:id="Sec-I" xreflabel="[Sec-I]"/>
This is the introduction to Part I.</simpara>
<simpara>In this section, we  explore the fundamentals of information technology delivery.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Scenario</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>You are working in a startup, alone or with one or two partners. You are always in the same room, easily able to carry on a running conversation about your efforts and progress. You have no time or resources to spend on anything except keeping your new system alive and running.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Chapter 1: IT Value</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Chapter 1 introduces you to the fundamental concepts of IT value that serve as a basis for the rest of the course. Why do people want computing (IT) services? What are the general outlines of their structure? How do they come into being? How are they changed over time?</simpara>
<simpara>All of this is essential to understand for your scenario; you need to understand what computers can do and how they are generally used, if you are going to create a product based on them.</simpara>
<simpara>This chapter also covers the basics of how you&#8217;ll approach building a product. It&#8217;s assumed you won&#8217;t develop an intricate, long-range plan but rather will be experimenting with various ideas and looking for "fast feedback" on their success or failure.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Chapter 2: IT Infrastructure</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>In this chapter, you have a general idea for a product and are ready to start building it. But not so fast&#8230;&#8203; you need to decide some fundamentals first. How will your new product run? What will you use to build it?</simpara>
<simpara>It&#8217;s not possible to begin construction until you decide on your tools. This chapter will provide you an overview of computing infrastructure including Cloud hosting and various approaches to system configuration.</simpara>
<simpara>This chapter also presents an overview of source control, as even your infrastructure depends on it in the new world of "infrastructure as code."</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">Chapter 3: Application delivery</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>Finally, you&#8217;re ready to start building something. While this is not a book on software development or programming languages, it&#8217;s important to understand some basics and at least see them in action.</simpara>
<simpara>This is also the "DevOps" chapter; it&#8217;s not just about writing code, but about the entire end to end system that gets the code you are writing from your workstation, into collaborative environments, and finally to a state where it can be accessed by end users. From source repository to build manager to package repository to production, we&#8217;ll cover a basic toolchain that will help you understand modern industrial practices.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">This section&#8217;s lab approach</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>While this is not a book about any particular computing language or platform, we need to describe some technical fundamentals. We’ll do so in as neutral a manner as possible. However, this books’ accompanying labs are based on <link xl:href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</link> and <link xl:href="https://git-scm.com/">git</link>, the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds to facilitate Linux development.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>Part II, like the other parts, needs to be understood as a unified whole. In reality, digital entrepreneurs struggle with the issues in all three chapters simultaneously.</simpara>

<section xml:id="Intro-Chap-1">
<title>Chapter 1. IT Value</title>
<section xml:id="_introduction">
<title>Introduction</title>
<simpara>As noted at the outset, you are a small core of a startup. You are building a product of which IT is a significant part (otherwise why are you reading this book/in this class?) Your motivations are entrepreneurial; you want to create a successful business. You might be housed within a larger enterprise, but the thought experiment here is that you have substantial autonomy to order your efforts.</simpara>
<simpara>You want to do something that has a unique IT component. Regardless of your business, you will need accounting and legal services at a minimum, and very quickly payroll and HR, and so forth. Those things can (and should) be purchased as commodity services, if you are a small entrepreneur (I am not aware of any convincing arguments to the contrary, unless you are absolutely on the smallest of shoestring budgets and can work 100 hour weeks). Your unique value proposition will be expressed to some degree in unique IT software. While this software may be based on well understood products, the configuration and logic you construct will be all your own. Because of this, you are now a producer (or soon to be) of IT services.</simpara>
<simpara>Before we can talk about building and managing information technology (IT), we need to understand what it is and why people want it. We&#8217;ll start this chapter by looking at an IT value experience that may seem very familiar. Then we&#8217;ll dig further into concepts like the "IT stack" and the "IT service" and how they change over time.</simpara>

<simpara>The mainframe is now running the latest version of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS">IBM’s zOS</link> <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</link> (a direct descendant of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors#MVT">OS/360</link>, one of the most  significant operating systems in the <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing">history of computing</link>). The "customer demand deposit" banking application running on the mainframe is still based on code written in the lowest level <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembler</link>. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency. Although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio for such a project has to date not been favorable.</simpara>
<simpara>The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud</link> data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</link> are newer, the <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</link> is structured very differently, and the operating system is <link xl:href="https://www.linux.com/">Linux</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.</simpara>

<title>Various forms of IT value</title>
<simpara>As we have seen, there are many ways in which digital systems deliver value. Some systems serve as the modern equivalent of file cabinets: massive and secure storage for financial transactions, insurance records, medical records, and the like. Other systems enable the transmission of information around the globe, whether as emails, web pages, voice calls, video on demand, or data to be displayed in a smart phone application ("app"). Some of these systems support engaged online communities and social interactions, with conversations, media sharing, and even massive online gaming ecosystems. Yet other systems enable penetrating analysis and insight, by examining the volumes of data contained in the first two kinds of systems for patterns and trends. Sophisticated statistical techniques and cutting edge approaches like neural network-based machine learning increase the insights our digital systems are capable of, at a seemingly exponential rate.</simpara>
<simpara>Digital technology generates value in both direct and indirect ways. People have long consumed (and paid for) communication services, such as telephone services. Broadcast entertainment was a different proposition, however. The "consumer" - the person with the radio or television - was not the "customer" - the person paying for the programming to go out over the airwaves. New business models sprung up to support the new media, through the sale of advertising air time. In other words, the value proposition was indirect, or at least took multiple parties to achieve: the listener, the broadcaster, and the advertiser. Finally, some of the best known uses of digital technology were and are very indirect - the above-mentioned banks and insurance agencies using the earliest computers to automate the work of thousands of typists and file clerks.</simpara>
<simpara>From these early business models have evolved and blossomed myriads of creative applications of digital technology, for the benefit of human beings in their ongoing pursuit of happiness and security. We see the applications mentioned at the outset: online banking, messaging, restaurant reservation, and traffic systems. Beyond that we see the use of digital technology in nearly every aspect of life. (And I say "nearly" only because I am a cautious person.)</simpara>
<simpara>Digital and information technology pervades all of the major industry verticals (manufacturing, agriculture, finance, retail, healthcare, transportation, services, and so on) and common industry functions (supply chain, human resources, corporate finance, and even IT itself).</simpara>
<simpara>Digital systems and technologies also are critical components of larger scale industrial, military, and aerospace systems. For better or worse, general purpose computers are increasingly found controlling safety-critical infrastructure, and serving as an intermediating layer between human actions and machine response. Robotic systems are based on software, and the Internet of Things ultimately will span billions of sensors and controllers in interconnected webs monitoring and adjusting all forms of complex operations across the planet.</simpara>

<section xml:id="_what_is_it_anyways">
<title>What is IT, anyways?</title>
<simpara>We’ve started this book in the previous section by providing an example of digital or IT value, without much discussion of how it is delivered. This is deliberate. But what is IT (Information Technology), anyways?</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The computers? The networks?</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The people who run them?</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>That organization under a Chief Information Officer that loves to say “no” and is always slow and expensive?</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>None of these are how this book defines “IT.” Although this is not a technical book on computer science or software engineering, the intent is that it reflects and is compatible with foundational principles.</simpara>
<simpara>“Information technology” is ultimately based on the work of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</link>, <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</link>, <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</link>, <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</link>, and the other pioneers who defined the central problems of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</link>, <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">digital logic</link>,  <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</link>, and <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">computer architecture</link>.</simpara>
<simpara><anchor xml:id="IT-as-function" xreflabel="[IT-as-function]"/></simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, as an organizational function, information technology also draws on organizational theory, systems theory, human factors and psychology, and more recent concepts such as design thinking, among many other areas.</simpara>
<simpara>Discussions of “information technology” become contentious because some think of the traditional organization, while others think of the general problem area. IT has a long history as a corporate function, a single hierarchy under a powerful Chief Information Officer. This model has had its dysfunctions, including a longstanding reputation for being slow and expensive. Often, when one encounters the term “IT,” the author using the term is referring to this organizational tradition.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis role="strong">We are less interested in the future of IT as a distinct organizational structure. There are many different models, from fully centralized to fully embedded.</emphasis> Organizational structure will be discussed in Chapter 7.</simpara>
<simpara>For this book, we define “Information technology” in terms of its historic origins. We look to IT’s common origins in automating the laborious and error prone processes of computation, through the application of digital logic technologies based on information transmission.</simpara>
<simpara>Regardless of organizational form or delivery methods, IT is defined by these origins. And there are notable common threads throughout this problem domain: the fragility and complexity of these systems, the need for layered abstractions in their management, and more.</simpara>
<simpara>It does not matter if the application developers ultimately report up through the CIO, the CMO, the CFO, or the COO. Their daily experience remains largely the same. The dynamics of their management remain the same. Executives who seek to take control of IT so they can “remove that old bureaucracy” are well advised to be cautious; the bureaucracy emerged for a reason. More on this in subsequent chapters.</simpara>

<simpara>IT increasingly permeates business operations and social interactions. The breadth and depth of IT support for virtually all domains of society continues to expand. Lately, this is known as digital transformation.</simpara>
<simpara>The role of information technology seems critical to society and the economy, but there are various points of view. Nicholas Carr, in his controversial <emphasis>Harvard Business Review</emphasis> article "IT Doesn&#8217;t Matter," recognized that IT was becoming commoditized in an important sense <xref linkend="Carr2003"/>. As Cloud providers started to offer utility-style computing, the choice of particular vendors of computers was no longer strategic. Looking to history, Carr argued that just as businesses no longer have “Vice Presidents for Electricity,” so businesses no longer need Chief Information Officers or dedicated IT departments.</simpara>
<note>
<simpara>A "commodity" product is one that is offered from a variety of suppliers, with little or no difference between their offerings. Commodity products tend to compete on price, not on differences in features. Wheat is a commodity. Sports cars are not. "Commoditization" is the process by which products that used to compete by being different, increasingly compete on price.</simpara>
</note>
<simpara>Carr has insight&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there is no question IT is becoming pervasive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but he ultimately reflects a narrow view of what “IT” is. If “IT” were merely computation at the lowest level&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just shuffling bits of information around, doing a little math&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then perhaps it could be embedded throughout a business like electricity.</simpara>
<simpara>But IT has emergent aspects that are not comparable to electrical power. As it pervades all dimensions of business operations, it brings its concerns with it: complexity, fragility, and the skills required to cope with them.</simpara>
<simpara>One watt of electrical power is like any other watt of electrical power, and can usefully be seen as a commodity. We can use it to run toasters, hair dryers, or industrial paint mixers, and there is little concern (beyond supply and demand management) that the consumption of power by the paint mixer will affect the toaster.  It&#8217;s also true that one cycle of computing, in a certain sense, is like any other cycle. But information technology systems interact with each other in surprising and unpredictable ways, orders of magnitude more complex than electrical power grids. (This is not to imply the modern electrical grid is a simple system!)</simpara>
<simpara>IT also radically transforms industries: from retail to transportation to manufacturing to genetics. Applied software-centric IT is unleashing remarkable economic disruption.</simpara>
<simpara>A lawyer may depend on a cell phone, and (in keeping with Carr) beyond its provision as a commodity service, needs little else to deliver the legal strategies a firm needs. A graphic designer may use computerized graphic tools, but these have become relatively standardized and commoditized in the past twenty years, and probably are not a source of competitive advantage in the quest for new marketing clients.</simpara>
<simpara>On the other hand, consider a text analytic algorithm that replaces thousands of paralegals, resulting in order-of-magnitude more accurate legal research in a fraction of cost and time. This <emphasis role="strong">is</emphasis> strategic and disruptive to the legal community. A superior supply chain algorithm, and the ability to improve it on an ongoing basis, may indeed elevate a logistics firm’s performance above competitors. In cases like these&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and they seem to be increasing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;IT matters very much.</simpara>
<simpara>In the digitally transforming economy, traditional “back office” IT organizations find themselves called on to envision, develop, and support market-facing applications of IT. And what starts with one market-facing use case can quickly expand into entire portfolios.  It is such cases that are of particular concern in this book.</simpara>
<simpara>Ultimately, it is possible that IT is the <emphasis role="strong">most</emphasis> strategic capability an organization can invest in. As the editor in chief of <emphasis>IEEE Software</emphasis> notes <xref linkend="Spinellis2015"/>,</simpara>
<blockquote>
<attribution>
Diomidis Spinellis
<citetitle>IEEE Software</citetitle>
</attribution>
<simpara>other industries are also producing what’s in effect software (executable knowledge) but not treating it as such . . . Although many industries have developed their own highly effective processes over the years, software engineering maintains an essential advantage. It has developed methods and tools that let even small teams manage extremely high complexity . . . This advantage is important because the complexity in non-software activities is also increasing inexorably . . . [T]he time has come to transform our world… by giving back to science and technology the knowledge software engineering has produced.</simpara>
</blockquote>
<simpara>This ability to manage complexity, to turn tacit into explicit and formalize the previously unstructured, is an essential aspect of digital transformation.</simpara>

<title>Defining "IT"</title>
<simpara>So, how do we define an IT problem, as opposed to other kinds of business problems? An IT problem is any problem where you are primarily constrained by your capability and understanding of IT.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you need computer scientists or engineers who understand the fundamentals of information theory and computer science, you are doing IT.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you need people who understand when your information-centric problems might need to be referred to such theorists and engineers, you are likely doing IT.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>If you need people who are skilled in building upon those fundamentals, and operating technical platforms derived from them (such as programming languages, general purpose computers, and network routers), you are doing IT.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Regardless of whether IT is housed under a traditional CIO, an operations capability, a Chief Marketing Officer, or a “line of business”, when it is critical to operations certain concerns inevitably follow:</simpara>

<simpara>Let&#8217;s examine our diner&#8217;s value experience in more detail, without getting unnecessarily technical, and clarify some definitions along the way.  The first idea we need to cover is the "moment of truth." In terms of information technnology, this English-language cliché represents the user&#8217;s experience of value.</simpara>
<simpara>In the example, our friend seeking a relaxing night out had several moments of truth:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Consulting her bank balance, and subsequent financial transactions also reflecting what was stated to her</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Making a reservation and having it honored on arrival at the restaurant</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Arriving on time to the restaurant, courtesy of the traffic application</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>And most importantly, having a relaxed and refreshing time with her friends.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Each of these individual value experiences was co-created by our friend&#8217;s desire for value, and the response of a set of IT resources.</simpara>
<important>
<simpara>The "moment of truth" represents the user&#8217;s experience of value, from a product, good, or service.</simpara>
</important>
<simpara>In order to view her balance, our user is probably using an application downloaded from a "store" of applications made available to her device. On her device, this "app" is part of an intricate set of components performing functions such as:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>accepting "input" (user intent) through a screen or voice input</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>processing that input through software and acting on her desire to see her bank balance</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>connecting to the phone network</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>securely connecting over the phone network to the Internet and then to the bank</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>identifying the user to the bank&#8217;s systems</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>requesting the necessary information (in this case, an account balance)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>receiving that information and converting it to a form that can be represented on a screeen</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>finally, displaying the information on the screen</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The application, or "app," downloaded to the phone plays a primary role, but is enabled by:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>the phone&#8217;s operating system and associated services</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>the phone&#8217;s hardware</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>the telecommunications infrastructure (cell phone towers, long distance fiber optic cables, switching offices, and much more)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Of course, without the banking systems on the other end, there is no bank balance to transmit. These systems are similar, but on a much larger scale than our friend&#8217;s device:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Internet and middleware services to receive the request from the international network</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Application services to validate the user&#8217;s identity and route the request to the appropriate handling service</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Data services to store the user&#8217;s banking information (account identity and transactions) along with millions of other customers</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Many additional services to detect fraud and security attacks, report on utilization, identify any errors in the systems, and much more.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Physical data centers full of computers and associated hardware including massive power and cooling infrastructure, and protected by security systems and personnel.</simpara>

<simpara>Consider: what does all this mean to our user? Does she care about cell phone towers, or middleware, or triply-redundant industrial-strength Power Distribution Units? Usually, not in the least.</simpara>
<simpara>Therefore, as we study this world, we need to maintain awareness of her perspective. Our friend is seeking some value that IT uniquely can enable, but does not want to consider all the complexity that goes into it. She just wants to go out with friends. The moment of truth depends on the service; the service may contain great complexity, but part of its success lies in shielding the user from that complexity.</simpara>

<simpara>Always remember the user&#8217;s experience. Information technology has a well deserved reputation for being too complicated for end users&#8212;&#8203;for example, trying to do something that should be simple, and finding oneself in a technical conversation about network settings.</simpara>
</important>

<section xml:id="_what_versus_how">
<title>What versus how</title>
<simpara>This fundamental tension between <emphasis role="strong">what</emphasis> a system is supposed to do, versus <emphasis role="strong">how</emphasis> it does it, pervades IT management and will likely define your career. "Don&#8217;t trouble me with the details, just give me the results" is the overall theme, and we encounter this reaction to complexity in many aspects of life.</simpara>
<simpara>Terminology is important. We need to have a more precise way of describing the information technology, beyond just saying there is "lots" of it. A variety of terms are used in this text:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>IT service</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Application</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>IT system</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>IT infrastructure</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>We also see discussion of components, resources, subsystems, assets, and many more terms.</simpara>
<warning>
<simpara>There are many debates around these definitions. Sometimes these debates are helpful in clarifying the terminology you want to use on your team. But sometimes the debates don&#8217;t add any value. Beware of anyone who claims there is a "best practice" here.</simpara>
</warning>
<simpara>In general, in this book, we will use the following definitions:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>An IT service is defined primarily in terms of WHAT not HOW</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Defining an IT system may include a discussion of both WHAT it does and HOW it does it</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>An "application" usually means some IT service or system for end users who are not primarily concerned with IT other than wanting to get something done with it (e.g. go out to dinner)</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>"Infrastructure" usually means some IT service or system that primarily supports OTHER IT services or systems (e.g. a network "service" is not usually useful to end users without additional application services.)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Finally, the concept of the "IT stack" is important. Notice how the different technology layers appear "stacked." Layered approaches to understanding IT are common; see Further Reading for useful references.</simpara>
<sidebar>
<title>Author&#8217;s note: Service versus product</title>
<simpara>For the purposes of this book, "IT services" are equivalent to "products." You may in other contexts hear phrases like "products <emphasis role="strong">versus</emphasis> services" which imply that they are distinct. Usually, when products are contrasted with services, people are equating products with goods: a jar of peanut butter is a "product," while a haircut is a service.</simpara>
<simpara>However, when I worked at AT&amp;T, the internal term for offerings like broadband networking access was not "service," but "product." Services, in this sense, <emphasis role="strong">are</emphasis> products.</simpara>
<simpara>In this book, we see products and services as roughly equivalent, but the two terms have some different connotations. Products usually imply an external market, where services can be either internal or external facing. While we certainly talk about "product marketing", the term "service marketing" is rarely seen. Furthermore,  some organizations such as Target have recently re-conceptualized internal services organizations as "product teams."</simpara>

<section xml:id="_the_it_service_lifecycle">
<title>The IT service lifecycle</title>
<simpara>We&#8217;ve established that the IT service is based on a complex stack of technology, from local devices to global networks to massive data centers. Software and hardware are layered together in endlessly inventive ways to solve problems people did not even know they had ten years ago.</simpara>
<simpara>But these IT service systems must come from somewhere. They must be designed, built, and operated, and (as any smartphone user can testify) they are continually improved over time.</simpara>
<simpara>A simple representation of the IT service lifecycle is shown in the figure below.</simpara>
<orderedlist numeration="arabic">
<listitem>
<simpara>It starts with an idea. Someone has an insight into an IT-enabled value proposition that can make a profit, or better fulfill a mission.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The idea must garner support and resources so that it can be built.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The idea is then constructed, at least as an initial proof of concept or Minimum Viable Product (in the language of Ries' <emphasis>Lean Startup</emphasis>.) Construction is assumed to include an element of design; in this textbook, <emphasis role="strong">construction and design are not represented as two separate phases.</emphasis></simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>There is a critical state transition however that will always exist. Initially, it is the change from OFF to ON when the system is first constructed. After the system is ON, there are still distinct changes in state when new features are deployed, or incorrect behaviors ("bugs" or "defects") are rectified.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The system may be ON, but it is not delivering value until the user can access it. Sometimes, that may be as simple as providing someone with a network address, but usually there is some initial "provisioning" of system access to the user, who needs to identify themselves.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The system can then deliver services (moments of truth) to the end users. It may deliver millions or billions of such experiences, depending on its scale and how one might choose to count the subjective concept of value experience.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The user may have access, but may still not receive value, if they do not understand the system well enough to use it. Whether via a formal service desk, or informal social media channels, users of IT services will require and seek support on how to maximize the value they are receiving from the system.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Sometimes, support requests indicate that something is wrong with the system itself. If the system is no longer delivering value experiences (bank balances, restaurant reservations, traffic directions) then some action must be taken promptly to restore service.</simpara>

<title>Defining consumer, customer, and sponsor</title>
<simpara>In understanding IT value, it is essential to clarify the definitions of user, customer, and sponsor, and understand their perspectives and motivations. Sometimes, the user <emphasis role="strong">is</emphasis> the customer. But more often, the user and the customer are different, and one may additionally need to distinguish the role of system or service sponsor.</simpara>
<simpara>The following definitions may help</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>The <emphasis role="strong">consumer</emphasis> (sometimes called the <emphasis role="strong">user</emphasis>) is the person actually interacting with the IT-based service.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The <emphasis role="strong">customer</emphasis> is a source of revenue for the service. If the service is part of a profit center, the customer is the person actually purchasing the product (e.g. demand deposit banking.) If the service is part of a cost center (e.g. an HR system), the customer is best seen as an internal executive, as the actual revenue-producing customers are too far removed.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>The <emphasis role="strong">sponsor</emphasis> is the person who authorizes and controls the funding used to construct and operate the service.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Depending on the service type, these roles can be filled by the same or different people. Here are some examples:</simpara>

<simpara>So, who paid for our user&#8217;s enjoyment? The bank and restaurant both had clear motivation for supporting a better online experience, and people now expect that service organizations provide this. The bank experiences less customer turnover and increased likelihood that customers add additional services. The restaurant sees increased traffic and smoother flow from more efficient reservations. Both see increased competitiveness.</simpara>
<simpara>The traffic application is a somewhat different story. While it is an engineering marvel, there is still some question as to how to fund it long term. It requires a large user base to operate, and yet end consumers of the service are unlikely to pay for it. At this writing, the service draws on advertising dollars from businesses wishing to advertise to passersby, and also sells its real-time data on traffic patterns to a variety of customers, such as developers considering investments along given routes.</simpara>
<simpara>This last example well illustrates the maxim that "if you don&#8217;t know how the product is making money, you are the product."</simpara>

<simpara>Like the proverbial fish that doesn&#8217;t understand water (because water it all it knows), we may lose sight of the laws and customs that enable us to use computers in the ways covered in this chapter.</simpara>
<simpara>For example, the ability for banks to hold money as electronic bits on a computer is rooted in the earliest history of banking and the emergence of centralized settlement and clearing mechanisms. Cell phone companies rely on international treaties, and national laws and regulations allocating radio spectrum.</simpara>
<simpara>The existence of physical voice and data connectivity relies on laws supporting utility easements and rights of way, and even treaties such as the Law of the Sea (how is it that undersea cables remain unmolested?).</simpara>

<simpara>As you consider embarking on a journey of IT value, you need to orient to your surroundings and create an initial proposal or plan for how you will proceed. If you are actually a startup, you need a business plan. If you are working as an intrapreneur in a larger organization, you will still need some kind of formal proposal. This section describes some tools and thinking approaches that may be useful at this very earliest stage. There are more focused, product-specific techniques in the chapter section on <link linkend="prod-discovery-techniques">product discovery techniques</link>.</simpara>
<section xml:id="_market_facing_supporting_back_office">
<title>Market facing, supporting, back office</title>
<simpara>In Chapter 1 we discussed the question of "who pays/who benefits" for the service, <link xl:href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_consumer_customer_and_sponsor">proposing that</link> the service consumer, the service customer, and the service sponsor might be three distinct roles (sometimes collapsing into 2 or 1 individual.)</simpara>
<simpara>We see this again in how we can categorize the "customers" of IT services and systems. Roughly, such services can be:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Directly market- and consumer-facing (e.g. Facebook), to be used by external consumers and paid for by either them or closely associated customers (e.g. Netflix, or an online banking system).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Customer "supporting" systems, such as the online system that a bank teller uses when interacting with a customer. Customers do not interact directly with such systems, but customer-facing representatives do, and problems with such systems may be readily apparent to the end customer.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Completely "back-office" systems (HR, payroll, marketing, etc)</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Note however, that (especially in the current digitally transforming market) a service previously thought of as "back office" (when run internally) becomes "market-facing" when developed as a profit-seeking offering. For example, an HR system built internally is "back office," but Workday is a directly market-facing product, even though the two services may be similar in functionality.</simpara>
<simpara>In other words, it&#8217;s all relative.</simpara>
<simpara>Especially when products are <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> market facing, we start to run into the problem of distinguishing <link linkend="discovery-v-design">discovery versus design</link>, as we discuss below.</simpara>
</section>
<section xml:id="_diffusion_theory_and_other_approaches">
<title>Diffusion theory and other approaches</title>
<simpara>As you start to think about digital value, you must think about the context for your startup or product idea. What is the likelihood of its being adopted? Is it part of a broader "movement" of technological innovation? Where is the customer base in terms of its willingness to adopt the innovation? A well known approach is the idea of the "diffusion theory," first researched by Everett Rogers and proposed in his <emphasis>Diffusion of Innovations,</emphasis> <xref linkend="Rogers2003"/>.</simpara>
<simpara>Rogers' research proposed the idea of "Adopter Categorization on the Basis of Innovativeness," with a well-known graphic:</simpara>
<figure>

<textobject><phrase>diffusion-graph</phrase></textobject>

</figure>
<simpara>Rogers went on to characterize the various stages:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Innovators: Venturesome risk-takers</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Early adopters: Opinion leaders</simpara>

<simpara>Early majority: Deliberative, numerous</simpara>

<simpara>Late majority: Skeptical, also numerous</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Laggards: Traditional, isolated, conservative</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The above figure was popularized in the following variation by Geoffrey Moore <xref linkend="Moore2014"/> in his bestseller <emphasis>Crossing the Chasm</emphasis>:</simpara>

<textobject><phrase>chasm-graph</phrase></textobject>
</mediaobject>
</figure>
<simpara>You&#8217;ll see this diagram often, but you should be aware that Rogers himself (the person who has researched the data) says that (p.282):</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>Past research shows no support for this claim of a “chasm” between certain adopter categories. On the contrary, innovativeness, if measured properly, is a continuous variable and there are no sharp breaks or discontinuities between adjacent adopter categories (although there are important differences between them)</emphasis>.</simpara>
<simpara>The idea of technology diffusion frames the problem for us, but we need more. Steve Blank, in his influential book <emphasis>The Four Steps to Epiphany</emphasis> <xref linkend="Blank2013"/>, argues there are four categories for startups (p.31):</simpara>
<itemizedlist>

<simpara>Startups that are entering an existing market</simpara>

<listitem>
<simpara>Startups that are creating an entirely new market</simpara>

</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Startups that want to re-segment an existing market as a niche player</simpara>

</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Understanding which category you are attempting is critical, because "the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance."</simpara>

<simpara>In this chapter, we discussed the basic questions of information technology value and how it is experienced and developed. Through the mechanism of a hypothetical modern IT user, we covered (at a <emphasis role="strong">very</emphasis> high level) the necessary ingredients of the IT experience. We considered the user&#8217;s moment of truth, and the massive IT complexity that sustains it. We also discussed a high level lifecycle model for IT applications and services, and explored some initial definitions for user, customer, and sponsor - critical distinctions to make in an age of digital transformation.</simpara>
