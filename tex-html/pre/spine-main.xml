      <p>Agile IT Management is a perfect fit for my Management Information Systems class to introduce students to the fast-paced world of IT Infrastructure that they will be dealing with shortly upon graduation. This book uses multiple perspectives (Founder, Team Leader, VP, C-level executive) to demonstrate to the student not only how a business grows, but how they need to continually grow their skill set. The use of hands-on exercises encouraged by the format of this book complements my teaching style that allows students to learn by doing, failing and doing again. An additional benefit is that this book begins with a focus on the startup mentality which I will use in my Business Innovation class.</p>

    <title>Preface</title>
    <para xml:id="Chx1.p1">
      <p>In 2013, I was approached by Dr. Bhabani Misra, the head of the Graduate Programs in Software at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. Dr. Misra asked me to teach an “IT Infrastructure” course (SEIS660). The first semester of the class was well received enough for me to be invited back. However, there were complaints from the students that it was too “theoretical.” I was attempting to teach using an enterprise architecture style with many abstractions that did not engage students effectively. I also had a team project approach that immediately started the students out as the IT leadership team of a large corporation. This generated feedback that the students wanted something more practical; they were not going to be immediately hired as senior executives!</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Chx1.p2">
      <p>I took this feedback seriously. I especially gave thought to a practical aspect, and so started to develop a lab component. This was and is popular with the students. I also started to think about different approaches for structuring the class that would make more sense for a survey class with a wide spectrum of experience.</p>

    <para xml:id="Chx1.p4">
      <p>Initially, I assigned my first book <text font="italic">Architecture and Patterns for IT: Service Management, Resource Planning, and Governance</text> as a required text for the class. However, I did not write this as a textbook and its limitations became clearer and clearer. It has a strongly architectural approach, approaching the IT management problem as a series of <ref href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">views on a model</ref>. I do not recommend this as a pedagogical approach for a survey class. In thinking about how to make the experience more practical and understandable for students, I hit on the idea of structuring the course around an evolutionary, “emergence” model (summarized as “from startup to enterprise”).</p>
    </para>
    <para xml:id="Chx1.p5">
      <p>I approached my publisher with the idea of a 3rd edition that would pivot the existing material. They agreed to this and I started the rewrite. However, by the time I was halfway done with the first draft, I had a completely new book. Material from the previous work simply did not fit the emergence model used to structure the narrative.</p>

        <p>Modern Information Systems texts, especially at the undergraduate, survey level, take an “outside-in” approach to the course material, seeking to orient all students (whether IT/MIS specialists or not) as to the role and function of information systems and their possibilities and value in the modern enterprise. This book, by contrast, is an “inside-out” book, intended to prepare the student for a career in digital industry. âIndustryâ is broadly defined as both those industries that offer digital products per se, as well as industries that rely on digital technology instrumentally for delivering all kinds of products. A central theme of the book is that âIT,â considered as a component, represents an increasing proportion of ALL industrial products (both consumer and business facing). This is known as “digital transformation.”</p>

This book provides a clear and objective overview of these critical issues.

        <p>IT management at scale within an organization is a complex system. Complex systems do not respond well to dramatic perturbations. They are best changed incrementally, with careful monitoring of the consequences of each small change. (This is part of the systems theory foundation underlying the Agile movement.) This is why the book, especially in the later chapters, starts with relatively straightforward and uncritical presentations of the following topics:</p>

        <p>While these practices, and their associated approaches and policies, have caused friction with digital and Agile practitioners, they all have their reasons for existing. The goal of this book is to understand their interaction with the new digital approaches, but in order to do this we must first understand them on their own terms. It does no good to develop a critique based on misconceptions or exaggerations about what (for example) “process management” or “governance” is all about. Instead, we try to break these large and sometimes controversial topics down into smaller, more specific topics - “lowest common denominators,” perhaps:</p>

          <p>Joseph Campbell popularized the notion of an archetypal journey that recurs in the mythologies and religions of cultures around the world. From Moses and the burning bush to Luke Skywalker meeting Obi wan Kenobi, the journey always begins with a hero who hears a calling to a quest…The heroâs journey is an apt way to think of startups. All new companies and new products begin with an almost mythological visionâ a hope of what could be, with a goal few others can see…Most entrepreneurs feel their journey is unique. Yet what Campbell perceived about the mythological heroâs journey is true of startups as well: However dissimilar the stories may be in detail, their outline is always the same. —Steve Blank, The Four Steps to Epiphany <cite class="ltx_citemacro_cite">[<bibref bibrefs="Blank2013" separator="," show="Refnum" yyseparator=","/>]</cite></p>

        <p>The emergence model and overall book structure is discussed in depth in the main introduction. Here are some notes on the thought process. I have spent considerable time thinking (agonizing) about the correct ordering of the chapters within these sections. This is possibly the tenth or twelfth version of the chapter ordering. This is an area where I want critical review, but also have strong opinions.</p>

      <para xml:id="Chx2.S2.p5">
        <p>There is benefit to restricting the chapters to 12, as a typical semester runs 14 weeks and the book then fits quite nicely, with one chapter per class and allowing for an introductory session and final exam. (Trying to modfiy the semester system is out of scope for this project.) Of course, a two-semester series, with 2 weeks per chapter, would also work well; each half of the book is also a logical unit.</p>

        <p>The governing thought experiment is, “what would I turn my attention to next as my IT-based concerns scale up?” For example, I think work management (implying rudimentary workflow, e.g. Kanban) correctly comes before formalized project management, and project management comes before fully formalized process management (including frameworks such as CMMI, COBIT and ITIL).</p>

        <p>Note that this would be a testable and falsifiable hypothesis, if empirical research were done to inventory and characterize organization scaling patterns. If we found (for example) that a majority of organizations formalize governance, risk, security and compliance practices before formalizing project management, that would indicate that those chapters should be re-ordered.</p>

        <p>(In my experience, small/medium businesses may have some formal IT project management capability but security and governance are still tacit, not formalized. This does not mean security is not a concern, but they have not yet hired a CISO, nor instituted formal controls).</p>

        <p>The presence of Product Management at an early stage is intended to provoke. Product management is poorly addressed in most current CSci/MIS/IT education, as well as the reigning industry standards. Yet formalizing it is one of the earliest concerns for a startup, and the imperatives of the product vision drive all that comes after.</p>

        <p>Evidence to this effect is seen (as of 2015) at the University of California at Berkeley I-School, which has replaced its Project Management course with <ref href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i290m-lapm">Lean/Agile Product Management</ref>, taught currently by the esteemed Jez Humble.</p>

        <p>Also, you may notice that the chapter titles don’t necessarily reflect “Agile” terminology. This is also deliberate, as students are going into a diverse world of much long-established IT. Furthermore, putting “Agile” as a qualifier on each chapter seems gratuitous (e.g. “Agile Operations Management” instead of just “Operations Management.”)</p>

        <p>The first word of the book’s title is “Agile.” That declares the orientation, and the proof will be in the reading.

        <p>The book however is not a complete dismissal of older models of IT delivery. Wherever possible, Agile is presented as an evolutionary step relative to what has gone before. The specifics of “what’s different” are identified, in the interest of de-mystifying what can be a fraught and quasi-religious topic. In the words of Don Reinertsen, you can have “faith based Agile or science based Agile.” This book is strictly interested in the latter. Pointers to relevant theory are included, although this is NOT a theoretical text. That may come later.</p>

        <p>This emergence model can also be understood as an individual’s progression within a larger enterprise. Even if one starts from Day 1 at a Fortune 100 corporation, I believe the progression of one’s understanding still progresses through individual, to team, to “team of teams,” to enterprise. Of course, one may cease evolving one’s understanding at any of these stages, with corresponding implications for one’s career.</p>

        <p>Some of you may be familiar with the idea of a Minimum Viable Product, Minimum Marketable Release, or similar.

Whether or not you intend to pursue such endeavors, the startup journey is a powerful one for your learning. Large information technology organizations in enterprises sometimes gain a reputation for losing sight of business value. IT seems to be acquired and operated for its own sake. Statements like “we need to align IT with the business!” are too often heard.</p>

Great features, but your product is unstable and unreliable? Your customers will go to the competition.</p>

        <p>In the author’s experience, for example, startups avoid formalized process and project management. To the extent the concerns exist, they are <emph>tacit</emph> (understood or implied; suggested; implicit). Certainly, a small startup does not invest in an enterprise-class service desk tool supporting a full array of IT management processes or a full-blown project management office with its own vice president and associated portfolio automation. Simple work management, with a manual or automated Kanban board, is likely their choice for work management.</p>

      <para xml:id="Ch2.S4.p3">
        <p>But by the time they are a team of teams, specialization has emerged and more robust processes and tools are required. Finally, the more complex, enterprise-scale concerns at the end of the book are presented as part of a logical progression.</p>
      </para>
      <para xml:id="Ch2.S4.p4">
        <p>The danger of course is that the formalization effort may be driven by its own logic and start to lose track of the all-critical business context. By carefully examining these stages of maturation, and the industry responses to them, it is the author’s hope that the student will have effective tools to critically engage with the problem of scaling the digital organization.</p>

If you are reading this online, you can follow the links, but it’s not required. As you progress in your career, you will always be encountering new terminology. Part of what you need to learn is when it’s important to dig into it, and when you can let it pass for a time. You should be able to understand the gist presented below that these are complex systems based on a wide variety of technologies, some of them old, some new.</p>

          <p>Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user. <cite class="ltx_citemacro_cite">[<bibref bibrefs="Maza2016" separator="," show="Refnum" yyseparator=","/>]</cite></p>

          <p>As mentioned in the section introduction, you cannot start developing a product until you decide what you will build it with. (You may have a difficult time writing an app for a mobile phone if you choose the COBOL programming language!) You also need to understand something of how computers are operated, enough so that you can make decisions on how your system will run. Most startups choose to run IT services on infrastructure owned by a Cloud provider, but there are other options. Certainly, as you scale up, you’ll need to be more and more sophisticated in your understanding of your underlying IT services.</p>
