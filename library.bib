@article{Carr2003,
abstract = {Description: As information technology has grown in power and ubiquity, companies have come to view it as evermore critical to their success; their heavy spending on hardware and software clearly reflects that assumption. Chief executives routinely talk about information technology's strategic value, about how they can use IT to gain a competitive edge. But scarcity, not ubiquity, makes a business resource truly strategic--and allows companies to use it for a sustained competitive advantage. You gain an edge over rivals only by doing something that they can't. IT is the latest in a series of broadly adopted technologies--think of the railroad or the electric generator--that have reshaped industry over the past two centuries. For a brief time, these technologies created powerful opportunities for forward-looking companies. But as their availability increased and their costs decreased, they became commodity inputs. From a strategic standpoint, they no longer mattered. That's exactly what's happening to IT, and the implications are profound. In this article, HBR's Editor-at-Large Nicholas Carr suggests that IT management should, frankly, become boring. It should focus on reducing risks, not increasing opportunities. For example, companies need to pay more attention to ensuring network and data security. Even more important, they need to manage IT costs more aggressively. IT may not help you gain a strategic advantage, but it could easily put you at a cost disadvantage.},

IMS represents data in each of its "trees" (or hierarchy) by defining physical parents and physical children.

To traverse between the trees, it uses a construct called "logical parents" and "logical children".  In other words, a segment (or record) in one tree can have a logical parent in a different tree.  Hence, now you can have a network.},

@inproceedings{Hayes1999,
abstract = {The Department of Defense, like other organizations, is making wide use of internal and external information that is publicly available on the World Wide Web. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has recently developed the specification for an eXtensible Markup Language (XML) that enables the packaging of data and its metadata in a platform-independent, application-neutral manner. XML will enable search engines to be more discriminating (via metadata-based filter) when processing a search request. Additionally, XML provides a structure for applications to filter and manipulate information to directly meet the user's needs. These two capabilities will revolutionize information processing; but for this to occur, information providers must describe their data and information requesters must describe their requests in terms that are commonly shared (common metadata, multiple forms) within some defined community. The authors anticipate that XML will cause a metadata explosion to occur in the near future due to two basic causes: the ease in creating and packaging metadata with data coupled with the pent-up demand for techniques to improve searching for information resources. The widespread and growing awareness of metadata as a means to efficiently identify and locate resources is giving us a window of opportunity to invest in an infrastructure that can deliver these services. However, the agreements within some identified community of interest that are manifest in a common representation (community logical model) can not be allowed to become a relic sitting on a shelf. The common representation must become an active component in information retrieval.   This paper describes a strategy for managing, publicizing, sharing, and using metadata to identify and retrieve information resources within the Department of Defense that incorporates the use of XML as a data and metadata interchange format. The tools and refinements to current specifications and policy that will be necessary to build the infrastructure and make it used to support this vision are also described.},

As sources change, new ones become available, and others become unavailable (at least temporarily), it becomes very burdensome to maintain the necessary mappings and other metadata. We compare the administrative labor and data accessibility for two popular approaches: federated databases that derive each table in the global schema as a view over sources, and source-profile systems that describe each source's offerings as a view over the global tables. We then propose a hybrid process that combines their advantages.},

The actual implementation of laws surrounding intellectual property, privacy, reasonable searches, and breach notification will differ amongst various regions of the world, but the importance of these concepts is still universal. In order to begin to appreciate common legal concepts at work in today's global economy, an understanding of the major legal systems is required. These legal systems provide the framework that determines how a country develops laws pertaining to information systems in the first place. The three major systems of law are civil, common, and religious law. Civil law is employed by many countries throughout the world. The system of civil law leverages codified laws or statutes to determine what is considered within the bounds of law. Common law is the legal system used in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and most former British colonies, amongst others. Religious law serves as the third of the major legal systems. Religious doctrine or interpretation serves as a source of legal understanding and statutes.},

abstract = {An ontology of computing has been attempted with the intention of supporting, among other things, the development of curriculum. Computing is unusual in having 40 years of curriculum recommendations that have been very influential in determining what is taught in a large number of programs. The ontology offers an objective base on which to build a curriculum recommendation. The ontology is still evolving and the use in curriculum development is entering its first experiments. This paper describes the challenges of developing the ontology and the plans for its application in curriculum development.},

This pattern language restricts its context to those issues encountered in connecting an object-oriented system to a relational database system in a client-server architecture. This pattern language can be used to generate a database access architecture as well as to help validate currently existing software architectures, frameworks and tools. The better the software's design reflects the patterns - the better it solves problems encountered in this problem domain. Crossing Chasms's patterns are categorized into three groups: static, dynamic and clientserver. Static patterns deal with the definition of the relational schema and the object model. The Dynamic patterns section attempts to generate a set of solutions to implementing the behavior for instantiating objects from and passiivating objects to tables. Client/server patterns address solutions to the general set of problems found in the client/server architecture. It completes the list of issues that must be addressed in an object-relational system.},

Since this report is a snapshot of current work, the material described here may change before the handbook is published.   The theme of the report is that documenting an architecture entails documenting the set of relevant views of that architecture, and then completing the picture by documenting information that transcends any single view. The audience for Documenting Software Architectures is the community of practicing architects, apprentice architects, and developers who receive architectural documentation.},

We propose two strategies for im-proving overall availability using simple mechanisms that scale over large applications whose output behavior toler-ates graceful degradation. We characterize this degradation in terms of harvest and yield, and map it directly onto engi-neering mechanisms that enhance availability by improving fault isolation, and in some cases also simplify program-ming. By collecting examples of related techniques in the literature and illustrating the surprising range of applica-tions that can benefit from these approaches, we hope to motivate a broader research program in this area.},

Results show that most of the diagrams had a transient nature because of the high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings. Diagrams that documented design decisions were often externalized in these temporary drawings and then subsequently lost. Current visualization tools and the software development practices that we observed do not solve these issues, but these results suggest several directions for future research.},

abstract = {This paper presents a theoretical model of situation awareness based on its role in dynamic human decision making in a variety of domains. Situation awareness is presented as a predominant concern in system operation, based on a descriptive view of decision making. The relationship between situation awareness and numerous individual and environmental factors is explored. Among these factors, attention and working memory are presented as critical factors limiting operators from acquiring and interpreting information from the environment to form situation awareness, and mental models and goal-directed behavior are hypothesized as important mechanisms for overcoming these limits. The impact of design features, workload, stress, system complexity, and automation on operator situation awareness is addressed, and a taxonomy of errors in situation awareness is introduced, based on the model presented. The model is used to generate design implications for enhancing operator situation awareness and future directions for situation awareness research.},

abstract = {This position paper describes the sBrowser, a tool that we have used for more than five years for dealing with all kinds of models, meta-models and meta-meta-models. It is based on the formalisms of sNets, a kind of minimal representation system, similar to CDIF or the MOF. We present the corresponding tools in this workshop because we believe they could be used as well with other formalisms. The starting point is that we needed a general workbench for our needs of model engineering. First conclusions showed that a graphics-based drawing tool would be unusable and hence useless for manipulating graphs of more than several hundred nodes. Since the size of our graphs were at least one order of magnitude more, we had to propose a more suitable set of tools. In the end of the paper we show how we however reintroduced graphics presentation for very particular tasks. From the sBrowser prototype, the concept of a meta-browser has progressively emerged. It is mainly a browser that allows to navigate in various information spaces under the control of different meta-models.},

abstract = {Standardization experts in object modelling are having difficulties with defining the concept of role; for example, they are not sure of whether role is a type or an instance concept. This issue is a source of confusion in the UML standard, and prevents ISO experts to reach consensus and finalize a language for ODP enterprise modelling. In this paper, we make an in-depth analysis of the problem, find its likely causes, and come up with a proposal for a new ODP definition of role, as well as with definitions of related concepts. Our findings and our definitions provide a basis for reconciling the positions that people have about the concept of role.},

abstract = {A data-integration system provides access to a multitude
of data sources through a single mediated schema. A key
bottleneck in building such systems has been the labori-
ous manual construction of semantic mappings between the
source schemas and the mediated schema. We describe LSD,
a system that employs and extends current machine-learning
techniques to semi-automatically nd such mappings. LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for
a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings to-
gether with the sources to train a set of learners. Each
learner exploits a dierent type of information either in the
source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been
trained, LSD nds semantic mappings for a new data source
by applying the learners, then combining their predictions
using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accu-
racy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD
can incorporate domain constraints as an additional source
of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the
structural information in XML documents. Our approach
thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types
of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to
additional learners that may exploit new kinds of informa-
tion. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world
domains, and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings
with a high degree of accuracy.},

IMS represents data in each of its "trees" (or hierarchy) by defining physical parents and physical children.

To traverse between the trees, it uses a construct called "logical parents" and "logical children".  In other words, a segment (or record) in one tree can have a logical parent in a different tree.  Hence, now you can have a network.},

abstract = {Regardless of their market niche, most companies feel pressured to release software faster: within 12 to 18 months for non-Internet companies and as quickly as three to six months for Web ventures. To achieve these short cycles, companies like Microsoft and Netscape have adopted techniques that can halve traditional development times: Lean production tailors work processes, tool use, methods, and project management to eliminate waste and rework. Fast cycle time mandates using development processes that require only a fraction of the time and resources ordinary processes consume. As the scramble to innovate reduces development time, companies must seek nontraditional approaches to software quality. Both Microsoft and Netscape, for example, improve quality, reduce costs, and decrease production time on their large projects by applying prototyping techniques perfected on small projects. To identify what drives and characterizes Internet-speed development, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia State University, and the Software Engineering Institute interviewed software developers and project managers at nine companies that use these practices. This study, part of an ongoing project, revealed three important trends. Time drives development decisions based on pressures to reach market first. Quality depends on whether or not practices like parallel QA are in place, the importance customers place on quality, and developers' skill levels. Finally, development processes adjust as companies tweak their methods to achieve higher quality.},

abstract = {Our discussions with traditional developers and managers concerning agile software development practices nearly always contain two somewhat contradictory ideas. They find that on small, stand-alone projects, agile practices are less burdensome and more in tune with the software industry's increasing needs for rapid development and coping with continuous change. Managers face several barriers, real and perceived, when they try to bring agile approaches into traditional organizations. They categorized the barriers either as problems only in terms of scope or scale, or as significant general issues needing resolution. From these two categories, we've identified three areas - development process conflicts, business process conflicts, and people conflicts - that we believe are the critical challenges to software managers of large organizations in bringing agile approaches to bear in their projects.},

These models may describe various aspects of a system such as products, structural organization and processes. This latter category may be refined in manufacturing, software and business processes for example. Each of these sub-domains share common concerns such the definition of work items, performers, inputs and outputs. However, as they may be represented using separate meta-models, there is therefore a risk of facing an uncontrollable number of meta-models that all redefine similar modeling constructs. It would be a wise initiative to put all these contributions together and to study what may be common and what should stay specific. In this paper we underline some similarities between process meta-models and we sketch out how they could be organized.},

@article{Ahlemann2009,
abstract = {Project management information systems have changed considerably over the last decade. They no longer focus on scheduling and resource management alone. Instead, they have become comprehensive systems that support the entire life-cycle of projects, project programs, and project portfolios. In this context, project-oriented organizations are facing a new challenge: the design, implementation, and operation of project management information systems have become increasingly complex. Numerous processes have to be considered, diverse stakeholder interests taken into account, and corresponding software systems selected. The reference information model (RefModPM) presented in this article addresses this challenge and aims to accelerate the set-up of project information systems. RefModPM was developed with the help of 13 domain experts from German and Swiss enterprises. Furthermore, it is based on an analysis of 28 commercial project management software systems. RefModPM has already been applied in several projects and is the basis of the forthcoming German DIN norm for a standardized project management data model. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IPMA.},

abstract = {This position paper describes the sBrowser, a tool that we have used for more than five years for dealing with all kinds of models, meta-models and meta-meta-models. It is based on the formalisms of sNets, a kind of minimal representation system, similar to CDIF or the MOF. We present the corresponding tools in this workshop because we believe they could be used as well with other formalisms. The starting point is that we needed a general workbench for our needs of model engineering. First conclusions showed that a graphics-based drawing tool would be unusable and hence useless for manipulating graphs of more than several hundred nodes. Since the size of our graphs were at least one order of magnitude more, we had to propose a more suitable set of tools. In the end of the paper we show how we however reintroduced graphics presentation for very particular tasks. From the sBrowser prototype, the concept of a meta-browser has progressively emerged. It is mainly a browser that allows to navigate in various information spaces under the control of different meta-models.},

abstract = {Large projects rely increasingly on commercial off-the- shelf components, a trend that emphasizes the need for adequate metrics to quantify component quality. Handling the growth of these COTS-based systems requires new approaches to quality and risk management. The authors offer software-engineering metrics to aid developers and managers in analyzing their quality-improvement initiatives' return on investment and to facilitate the modeling of cost and quality. They assert that large-scale component reuse or COTS component acquisition can generate savings in development resources, which can be applied to improve quality and enhance reliability, availability, and maintenance. Further, metrics play a critical role in identifying risks that involve performance, reliability, adaptability, scheduling, and product evaluation. COTS products change rapidly, and research on COTS-based- system development is still in the early stages. Given that cost-effectiveness and quality provide the major factors in deciding for or against component acquisition, the authors see an urgent need for empirical and analytical research that will lead to more accurate cost and quality models for these systems.},

abstract = {Abstract—The problem of defining global views of heterogeneous data sources to support querying and cooperation activities is becoming more and more important due to the availability of multiple data sources within complex organizations and in global information systems. Global views are defined to provide a unified representation of the information in the different sources by analyzing conceptual schemas associated with them and resolving possible semantic heterogeneity. In the paper, we propose an affinity-based unification method for global view construction. In the method: 1) The concept of affinity is introduced to assess the level of semantic relationship between elements in different schemas by taking into account semantic heterogeneity; 2) Schema elements are classified by affinity levels using clustering procedures so that their different representations can be analyzed for unification; 3) Global views are constructed starting from selected clusters by unifying representations of their elements. Experiences of applying the proposed unification method and the associated tool environment artemis on databases of the Italian Public Administration information systems are described.},

The object header stored is stored in one physical table and object values are stored in tall, skinny value tables. Such structures provide power and flexibility but frequently baffle junior developers accustomed to relational tables.

It is possible to have the best of both worlds by physically storing data in abstract structures and automatically generating materialized views with INSTEAD-OF triggers to enable novice developers to build traditional applications against the flexible data structures. 

This paper will describe the architecture used to generate these materialized views, the technical challenges in making these views actually work and the pros and cons of using such structures.},

abstract = {A data-integration system provides access to a multitude of data sources through a single mediated schema. A key bottleneck in building such systems has been the labori- ous manual construction of semantic mappings between the source schemas and the mediated schema. We describe LSD, a system that employs and extends current machine-learning techniques to semi-automatically nd such mappings. LSD first asks the user to provide the semantic mappings for a small set of data sources, then uses these mappings to- gether with the sources to train a set of learners. Each learner exploits a dierent type of information either in the source schemas or in their data. Once the learners have been trained, LSD nds semantic mappings for a new data source by applying the learners, then combining their predictions using a meta-learner. To further improve matching accu- racy, we extend machine learning techniques so that LSD can incorporate domain constraints as an additional source of knowledge, and develop a novel learner that utilizes the structural information in XML documents. Our approach thus is distinguished in that it incorporates multiple types of knowledge. Importantly, its architecture is extensible to additional learners that may exploit new kinds of informa- tion. We describe a set of experiments on several real-world domains, and show that LSD proposes semantic mappings with a high degree of accuracy.},

At the same time, middleware and standards will make it feasible to access larger amounts of information, increasing the scope and heterogeneity of resources to be administered.

abstract = {Master IBM's Breakthrough DAD Process Framework for Succeeding with Agile in Large, Complex, Mission-Critical IT Projects It is widely recognized that moving from traditional to agile approaches to build software solutions is a critical source of competitive advantage. Mainstream agile approaches that are indeed suitable for small projects require significant tailoring for larger, complex enterprise projects. In Disciplined Agile Delivery, Scott W. Ambler and Mark Lines introduce IBM's breakthrough Disciplined Agile Delivery (DAD) process framework, which describes how to do this tailoring. DAD applies a more disciplined approach to agile development by acknowledging and dealing with the realities and complexities of a portfolio of interdependent program initiatives. Ambler and Lines show how to extend Scrum with supplementary agile and lean strategies from Agile Modeling (AM), Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban, Unified Process (UP), and other proven methods to provide a hybrid approach that is adaptable to your organization's unique needs. They candidly describe what practices work best, why they work, what the trade-offs are, and when to consider alternatives, all within the context of your situation. Disciplined Agile Delivery addresses agile practices across the entire lifecycle, from requirements, architecture, and development to delivery and governance. The authors show how these best-practice techniques fit together in an end-to-end process for successfully delivering large, complex systems--from project initiation through delivery. Coverage includes Scaling agile for mission-critical enterprise endeavors Avoiding mistakes that drive poorly run agile projects to chaos Effectively initiating an agile project Transitioning as an individual to agile Incrementally building consumable solutions Deploying agile solutions into complex production environments Leveraging DevOps, architecture, and other enterprise disciplines Adapting your governance strategy for agile projects Based on facts, research, and extensive experience, this book will be an indispensable resource for every enterprise software leader and practitioner--whether they're seeking to optimize their existing agile/Scrum process or improve the agility of an iterative process.},

@misc{Schwartz2014,
abstract = {How DevOps Can Fix Federal Government IT  The Federal Government spends more than {\$}80 billion each year on information technology. As the fiasco with healthcare.gov demonstrates, the results are not always good. Government IT programs are expensive and monolithic, and the lead time from a “mission need” to a deployed capability is often measured in years (in one of our agency's programs, about 12 years!). IT systems are often difficult to use, and the US government's online service offerings to citizens are far from meeting the expectations of a public that is used to Google, Facebook, and Twitter.  The US government has only recently begun to adopt agile approaches, and only in a few agencies. But the results have been encouraging, and show that it is possible for the bureaucracy to be agile. DevOps, however is a game changer. At USCIS we have moved to a continuous integration, continuous delivery approach, and have begun experimenting with a DevOps model tailored to the needs of the government.  By combining DevOps with some ideas taken from the Lean Startup movement, I believe we can cause a radical change in how the government does IT. We can dramatically reduce lead times and costs, improve the usability of systems, provide more transparency, create citizen-centric online services, and – importantly – significantly improve the government's security posture.  Bio  Mark Schwartz is the Chief Information Officer (CIO) of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), where he leads an IT organization that provides services to 20,000 employees who process 7 million benefit applications a year. His primary goal is to increase the IT organization's responsiveness to mission needs by reducing time from concept to deployment for new capabilities. To support this goal, Mr. Schwartz has introduced agile and lean development practices, continuous delivery, and DevOps to an organization that must work within the constraints of federal government policies. He has been a leader in introducing agile approaches to the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies.  Prior to USCIS, Mr. Schwartz was the CIO of Intrax Cultural Exchange, where his innovative Family Room application drove dramatic market share, revenue, and profit growth. This accomplishment was recognized by CIO Magazine with a CIO 100 award in 2006. Mr. Schwartz has also served as the CEO of Auctiva Corporation, a software company that provides software and services to buyers and sellers in online auction sites. In 2010 Mr. Schwartz was named one of the Premier 100 IT Leaders by Computerworld Magazine, and in 2013 Mr. Schwartz received a Federal 100 award from Federal Computer Week.  Mr. Schwartz holds a B.S. degree in Computer Science from Yale University, an M.A. in Philosophy from Yale University, and an M.B.A. from Wharton.},

abstract = {The increasing openness and heterogeneity of distributed computing systems requires the representation of meta-information in distributed environments. Most type management systems can only define types within particular type systems. In contrast, the DSTC's Meta-Object Facility (MOF) first defines a type system as a
set of meta-meta-objects, and then defines types as meta-objects which are described by those meta-meta-objects. This approach enables the definition of many type systems in one MOF, the composition of type systems, and the federation of type systems. This paper presents a conceptual framework for discussing metainformation and the meta-meta-objects that are the foundation of the DSTC's Meta-Object Facility (MOF), which is a tool for enabling heterogeneity, extensibility and openness.},

This paper defines information systems architecture by creating a descriptive framework from disciplines quite independent of Information systems, Men by analogy specifies Information systems architecture based upon the neutral, objective framework. Also, some preliminary conclusions about the implications of the resultant descriptive framework are drawn. The discussion is limited to architecture end does not include a strategic planning methodology.},

@inproceedings{BerntKullbach1998,
abstract = {This paper presents an approach to program comprehension
in multi-language systems. Such systems are characterized
by a high amount of source codes in various languages
for programming, database definition and job control.
Coping with those systems requires the references
crossing the language boundaries to be analyzed.
Using the EER/GRAL approach to graph-based conceptual
modeling, models representing relevant aspects of single
language are built and integrated into a common conceptual
model. Since conceptual modeling focusses on specific
problems, the integrated model presented here is especially
tailored to multi-language aspects. Software systems
are parsed and represented according to this conceptual
model and queried by using a powerful graph query
mechanism. This allows multi-language cross references to
be easily retrieved.
The multi-language conceptual model and the query facilities
have been developed in cooperation with the maintenance
programmers at an insurance company within the
GUPRO project.},

The adopted process entails the decomposition of the application portfolio into loosely coupled work-packets that can be independently and incrementally worked out by teams distributed on different sites.},

abstract = {The emergence of electronic marketplaces and other electronic services and applications on the Internet is creating a growing demand for effective management of resources. Due to the nature of the Internet such information changes rapidly. Furthermore, such information must be available for a large number of users and applications, and copies of pieces of information should be stored near the users that need this particular information. In this paper, we present the architecture of MDV, a distributed metadata management system. MDV has a 3-tier architecture and supports caching and replication in the middle-tier so that queries can be evaluated locally. Users and applications specify the information they need and that is replicated using a specialized subscription language. In order to keep replicas up-to-date and initiate the replication of new and relevant information, MDV implements a novel, scalable publish {\&} subscribe algorithm. We describe this algorithm in detail, show how it can be implemented using a standard relational database system, and present the results of performance experiments conducted using our prototype implementation.},

abstract = {Interoperability between digital libraries depends on effective sharing of metadata. Successful sharing of metadata requires common standards for metadata exchange. Previous efforts have focused on either defining a single metadata standard, such as Dublin Core, or building digital library middleware, such as Z39.50 or Stanford's Digital Library Interoperability Protocol.

In this article, we propose a distributed architecture for managing metadata and metadata schema. Instead of normalizing all metadata and schema to a single format, we have focused on building a middleware framework that tolerates heterogeneity. By providing facilities for typing and dynamic conversion of metadata, our system permits continual introduction of new forms of metadata with minimal impact on compatibility.},

Its internal mechanisms and related tools provide functionalities for querying data and observing dependencies between the components of the studied systems, facilitating core tasks conducted in reverse engineering, system comprehension, system analysis, and reengineering. This paper discusses the architecture, the schema, the mechanisms, and the implementation details of the repository, and examines the choice of the UML metamodel.

Executives in all industries are using digital advances such as analytics, mobility, social media and smart embedded devices – and improving their use of traditional technologies such as ERP – to change customer relationships, internal processes, and value propositions. Other executives, seeing how fast digital technology disrupted media industries in the past decade, know they need to pay attention to changes in their industries now. How can senior executives successfully lead digital transformation? While many experts urge companies to get started on the digital transformation journey, few tell how to do it. In this report we share the findings from a global study of how 157 executives in 50 large traditional companies are managing – and benefiting from – digital transformation.},

This implies a clear definition of mission and system are given at the outset (to reduce uncertainty), and subsequent execution in phases with decision gates. It contrasts with the approach applied in the seminal projects that are credited with establishing the foundation of the discipline in the 1940s and 1950s. Those projects started out with missions that were beyond the currently possible; any solutions had to emerge over time. They succeeded by a combination of parallel trials (from which the best would then be selected) and trial-and-error iteration (allowing for the modification of solutions pursued over a period of time). Although the success of these approaches was well documented and explained by scientific study in the 1950s, today they seem to fly in the face of accepted professional standards, making managers uncomfortable when they are encountered. The project management discipline has been relegated to an "order taker crucial strategic change initiatives facing many organizations today. The discipline of project management should be broadened in order to create greater value for organizations whose portfolios include novel and uncertain projects.},

@techreport{Bachmann2002,
abstract = {This report represents another milestone of a work in progress: a comprehensive handbook on how to produce high-quality documentation for software architectures. The handbook, tentatively titled Documenting Software Architectures, will be published in early 2002 by Addison-Wesley as part of the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Series on Software Engineering.   The book is intended to address a lack of language-independent guidance about how to capture an architecture in a written form that can provide a unified design vision to all of the stakeholders on a development project.   A central precept of the book is that documenting an architecture entails two essential steps: (1) documenting the set of relevant views of that architecture, and then completing the picture by (2) documenting information that transcends any single view. The books audience is the community of practicing architects, apprentice architects, and developers who receive architectural documentation.   This technical note describes ways to document an important but often overlooked aspect of software architecture: the behavior of systems, subsystems, and components.},

Global views are defined to provide a unified representation of the information in the different sources by analyzing conceptual schemas associated with them and resolving possible semantic heterogeneity. In the paper, we propose an affinity-based unification method for global view construction. In the method: 1) The concept of affinity is introduced to assess the level of semantic relationship between elements in different schemas by taking into account semantic heterogeneity; 2) Schema elements are classified by affinity levels using clustering procedures so that their different representations can be analyzed for unification; 3) Global views are constructed starting from selected clusters by unifying representations of their elements. Experiences of applying the proposed unification method and the associated tool environment artemis on databases of the Italian Public Administration information systems are described.},

abstract = {A new information system landscape is emerging that will be more model-centered than object-oriented, characterized by many models of low granularity and high abstraction, which describe static or dynamic aspects of enterprise information systems. This paper focuses more particularly on the organization of dynamic models that we call here active system frameworks (process models by opposition to product models). They cover, among other concerns, the organization of work, its assignment to potential performers and interactions between them. Agent technology is thus concerned in two ways. First, as active elements, they may intervene in a workflow in the same way as real persons. Second, some of their aspects (organization, processing and interaction) are also shared by other domains. All these schemes could and should be organized in a lattice of metamodels. The point of view taken here is essentially the one of the software engineering community. As we witness a rapid proliferation of product and process meta-models, the question of their overall organization arises. Inspiration may be provided in this field by some results of ontology engineering. We specifically point out at two practical areas of concern. First how to couple the meta-models of process and the meta-models of products. Second how to organize the various process meta-models involved in the design and maintenance of information systems.},

It then covers how to integrate objects into the relational model followed by how to implement that integration with current database systems. Next the issues for client-server objects are covered independently from the whole mapping problem. This leads to the conclusion, which finishes the preparation for analyzing specific object-relational approaches by reviewing the topics and describing object-relational approaches.},

abstract = {(July/August) Disciplined learning, or " learn early, learn often, " updates na{\"{i}}ve agile development and traditional risk management, and safely replaces the dreaded catch phrase, " fail early fail often. " Disciplined learning is a rich, creative and rewarding endeavor, already in use in small pockets of excellence. The team has (at least) four categories in which to learn: • What they should really be building, never mind what they thought they should build at the start. • Whether they have the right people on the team, and for those people, how best to work together. • Where their technical ideas are flawed. • How much it will cost to develop. In the strategy shown in Figure 1, these are all learned late in the project, around the time when the parts are integrated and deployed, when the consumers finally give feedback on the result. This learning arrives too late to benefit the product. The disciplined learning approach is to apply the same " broken " learning curve in very small doses, deliberately and often, so that each step provides information that can be used to adjust the four categories of learning. The payoff is not just reduced risk in the final delivery, but the ability of the sponsors to steer the final delivery in a fine-grained way, both in delivery time and delivered features and quality. Figure 2 illustrates the disciplined learning approach. The following four sections describe strategies for learning in the four categories.},

abstract = {In a component-based world, software acquisition and use will involve new processes and new roles. We survey the sorts of expertise needed in such a world, with particular attention to how components realize shared data and business logic for an enterprise. We describe how the software process can be organized so as to conserve scarce expertise in software technologies and in the target problem domain. We provide a taxonomy of expertise and tasks, where no task requires unrealistically many kinds of expertise.

We were able to identify nine (9) distinct forms of expertise, and more importantly could identify six (6) kinds of systems engineering tasks, where no single task requires more than three forms of expertise. We consider several tasks and roles that have not been widely studied, e.g., the task of salvaging business logic from legacy systems. We also address a shared enterprise information model as the means of communication between people with different expertise. From this study, we outline a methodology for system acquisition and use.},

abstract = {The First Guide to Scrum-Based Agile Product Management In "Agile Product Management with Scrum, leading Scrum consultant Roman Pichler uses real-world examples to demonstrate how product owners can create successful products with Scrum. He describes a broad range of agile product management practices, including making agile product discovery work, taking advantage of emergent requirements, creating the minimal marketable product, leveraging early customer feedback, and working closely with the development team. Benefitting from Pichler's extensive experience, you'll learn how Scrum product ownership differs from traditional product management and how to avoid and overcome the common challenges that Scrum product owners face. Coverage includes Understanding the product owner's role: what product owners do, how they do it, and the surprising implications Envisioning the product: creating a compelling product vision to galvanize and guide the team and stakeholders Grooming the product backlog: managing the product backlog effectively even for the most complex products Planning the release: bringing clarity to scheduling, budgeting, and functionality decisions Collaborating in sprint meetings: understanding the product owner's role in sprint meetings, including the dos and don'ts Transitioning into product ownership: succeeding as a product owner and establishing the role in the enterprise This book is an indispensable resource for anyone who works as a product owner, or expects to do so, as well as executives and coaches interested in establishing agile product management.},

abstract = {Many initiatives, governmental and commercial, have pursued the grand vision of "transparent access" - making all data available to all consumers (users and applications), in a way the consumer can interpret, anywhere and at any time.  Among large-scale enterprises, success stories in achieving such visions seem rare or nonexistent. Instead of leading one more charge "over the top", we suggest that a better guiding metaphor would be "continual evolution of a partially satisfactory system". This resembles what we have today, and what we will have in 2010. The key question, then, is: "How can the builders of each system/data-resource prepare to work with partners, including future, unknown partners". We address this by identifying first steps that may offer some immediate benefits, give crucial stakeholders (metadata providers) incentives to participate, and yet fit a long term vision of greatly increased access.},

@article{Wegscheider1997,
abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that building high-end business applications is unavoidably difficult because applications and the technology for implementing them are complex. Empirical evidence from real projects amply reinforces this conclusion. Building business applications requires technical knowledge about database design, entity relationship or object modeling, GUI design, middleware technology, programming languages, operating systems, prototyping tools, and so on. Pulling together a development environment and a knowledgeable team capable of tackling a large application can be a major hurdle in starting a new project. It can be argued that spiraling technical complexity makes it difficult to focus on the application's core business problem. Complicated prototyping tools may help with early rapid iteration, but they result in throwaway mock-ups that quickly lose sync with the application as it evolves. To reach a new level of productivity and quality in application building, we need something better. This article begins with a simple business application and attempts to sketch out what an "ideal" approach to specifying it might be. From this basic example, design and process patterns emerge that allow for the specification of a comprehensive environment that meets these criteria.},

abstract = {The increasing openness and heterogeneity of distributed computing systems requires the representation of meta-information in distributed environments. Most type management systems can only define types within particular type systems. In contrast, the DSTC's Meta-Object Facility (MOF) first defines a type system as a set of meta-meta-objects, and then defines types as meta-objects which are described by those meta-meta-objects. This approach enables the definition of many type systems in one MOF, the composition of type systems, and the federation of type systems. This paper presents a conceptual framework for discussing metainformation and the meta-meta-objects that are the foundation of the DSTC's Meta-Object Facility (MOF), which is a tool for enabling heterogeneity, extensibility and openness.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT This position paper reports on an initial investigation in the fields of MDA and generative approaches. Our view is that MDA aims at providing a precise framework for generative software production. Unfortunately many notions are still loosely defined (PIM, PSM, etc.).. We propose here an initial exploration of some basic artifacts of the MDA space. Because all these artifacts may be considered as assets for the organization where the MDA is being deployed, we are going to talk about MDA abstract components. We show in this paper the central role that the undergoing RFP on model query and transformation may play in the global MDA organization. Our position is that, if this RFP is successful, the resulting "UTL (Unified Transformation Language)" may soon become the cornerstone of the MDA and contribute to bring closer the generative techniques and the MDA communities.},

Exploratory clinical research in a mechanical manufacturing company was used and three areas of findings emerged. First, there is a need for congruence in time between organization and remuneration, since the remuneration system serves both as an obstructing and a facilitating force in the process. There is also a need for congruence between the principles of the organization and remuneration. Converting the complex goals of the manufacturing strategy into a correspondingly elaborate remuneration system is essential. Finally, proposes a two-part remuneration system for lean manufacturing. The first part of the system is a response to the founding principles of lean manufacturing: focusing on the competence of the individual. The second part is formed to remunerate the outcomes of a lean manufacturing system based on the performance of the team.},

There is an impedance mismatch between these technologies since objects consist of both data and behavior while a relational database consists of tables and relations between them. Although it is impossible to completely eliminate this impedance mismatch, you can minimize it by following the proper patterns. The proper patterns hide persistence from the developer so that effort can be spent on understanding the domain rather than in making objects persistent.},

abstract = {The Object Management Group is rapidly moving from its previous Object Management Architecture vision (OMA) to the newest Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). At the center of this framework, the so-called four-level meta-modeling architecture provides the foundations for building a variety of automatic and semi-automatic model-transformation and code-generation tools. The most important will be platform targeted code-generation tools but there are plenty of other possibilities that we can expect to become available in the near future. As an example, this paper shows how modern meta-modeling and meta-programming techniques may be combined to implement a new generation of software maintenance tools. The proposal deals with the future maintenance of software written in the C{\#} programming language, supported by the DotNet platform and uses all support available in the MDA framework (UML, MOF, XMI). In addition to this, we take advantage of the introspection properties of C{\#}. A similar approach could also be used with other modern programming languages like Smalltalk or, to a lesser extent, Java.},

abstract = {This survey characterizes an emerging research area, sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research in this area uses and extends ideas about coordination from disciplines such as computer science, organization theory, operations research, economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight of the framework presented here is that coordination can be seen as the process of managing dependencies among activities. Further progress, therefore, should be possible by characterizing different kinds of dependencies and identifying the coordination processes that can be used to manage them. A variety of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and commonalities across disciplines are identified. Processes analyzed include those for managing shared resources, producer/consumer relationships, simultaneity constraints, and tank/subtask dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a coordination perspective in three different domains: (1) understanding the effects of information technology on human organizations and markets, (2) designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing distributed and parallel computer systems. In the final section, elements of a research agenda in this new area are briefly outlined.},

Previous efforts have focused on either defining a single metadata standard, such as Dublin Core, or building digital library middleware, such as Z39.50 or Stanford's Digital Library Interoperability Protocol.  In this article, we propose a distributed architecture for managing metadata and metadata schema. Instead of normalizing all metadata and schema to a single format, we have focused on building a middleware framework that tolerates heterogeneity. By providing facilities for typing and dynamic conversion of metadata, our system permits continual introduction of new forms of metadata with minimal impact on compatibility.},

One of the main benefits of a unified modeling language is that it enables competition between tool vendors and allows users a wide choice of tools. Getting the most out of a tool - which is often a significant investment - means using it as more than a fancy drawing tool. In this position paper I will argue that the combination of XML and UML - especially in the form of XMI, the OMG's standard XML Metadata Interchange format - is crucial enabling technology for getting good value out of a UML tool. Indeed, I believe that it may revolutionise the use of modelling tools in future.},

There are, however, indications that firms in general find the concept of ITIL challenging, and that many firms are confused about how to implement ITIL successfully. This research has studied what are the most important factors for the successful adoption of ITIL, and bases its results and conclusions on a study in which a ranking-type approach to the Delphi method has been conducted in the Norwegian Armed Forces. A panel of experts on the adoption of ITIL has participated through the method three phases: brainstorming, reduction and ranking. The result is a ranked list of the most important factors, which clearly demonstrates that issues related to management, and leadership, competence and training, information and communication, stakeholders' involvement, and culture, are considered by the experts as most important. Factors related to technology and methodology was ranked lower. This paper validates the results of earlier studies, and provides additional knowledge about the factors that influence successful ITIL adoption. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or missed deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because they are building something nobody wants. Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls "validated learning" about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers and making constant adjustments"--},

abstract = {These patterns describe how to implement business objects so that they can be mapped to non objectoriented databases. There is an impedance mismatch between these technologies since objects consist of both data and behavior while a relational database consists of tables and relations between them. Although it is impossible to completely eliminate this impedance mismatch, you can minimize it by following the proper patterns. The proper patterns hide persistence from the developer so that effort can be spent on understanding the domain rather than in making objects persistent.},

The object header stored is stored in one physical table and object values are stored in tall, skinny value tables. Such structures provide power and flexibility but frequently baffle junior developers accustomed to relational tables.  It is possible to have the best of both worlds by physically storing data in abstract structures and automatically generating materialized views with INSTEAD-OF triggers to enable novice developers to build traditional applications against the flexible data structures.   This paper will describe the architecture used to generate these materialized views, the technical challenges in making these views actually work and the pros and cons of using such structures.},

Companies are increasingly realizing that the old, sequential approach to developing new products simply won't get the job done. Instead, com- panies in Japan and the United States are using a holistic method—as in rugby, the ball gets passed within the team as it moves as a unit up the field. This holistic approach has six characteris- tics: built-in instability, self-organizing project teams, overlapping development phases, "multilearning," subtle control, and organizational transfer of learning. The six pieces fit together like a jigsaw puzzle, forming a fast and flexible process for new product development, fust as im- portant, the new approach can act as a change agent: it is a vehicle for introducing creative, market-driven ideas and processes into an old, rigid organization. Mr. Takeuchi is an associate professor and Mr. Nonaka, a professor at Hitotsubashi University in fa- pan. Mr. Takeuchi's research has focused on marketing and global competition.

abstract = {The emergence of electronic marketplaces and other electronic services and applications on the Internet is creating a growing demand for effective management of resources. Due to the nature of the Internet such information changes rapidly. Furthermore, such information must be available for a large number of users and applications, and copies of pieces of information should be stored near the users that need this particular information. In this paper, we present the architecture of MDV, a distributed metadata management system. MDV has a 3-tier architecture and supports caching and replication in the middle-tier so that queries can be evaluated locally. Users and applications specify the information they need and that is replicated using a specialized subscription language. In order to keep replicas up-to-date and initiate the replication of new and relevant information, MDV implements a novel, scalable publish {\&} subscribe algorithm. We describe this algorithm in detail, show how it can be implemented using a standard relational database system, and present the results of performance experiments conducted using our prototype implementation.},

These will (gradually) change the way data intensive applications are developed, reduce databases' prominence in this process, and change data administration's goals and participants. At the same time, the database community needs to ensure that its experiences are leveraged and its concerns are met within the new methodologies and toolsets. We discuss these issues, and illustrate how they apply to a portion of the Department of Defense (DOD). We also examine things that object technology won't accomplish, and identify research problems whose solution would enable further progress.},

We survey the sorts of expertise needed in such a world, with particular attention to how components realize shared data and business logic for an enterprise. We describe how the software process can be organized so as to conserve scarce expertise in software technologies and in the target problem domain. We provide a taxonomy of expertise and tasks, where no task requires unrealistically many kinds of expertise.  We were able to identify nine (9) distinct forms of expertise, and more importantly could identify six (6) kinds of systems engineering tasks, where no single task requires more than three forms of expertise. We consider several tasks and roles that have not been widely studied, e.g., the task of salvaging business logic from legacy systems. We also address a shared enterprise information model as the means of communication between people with different expertise. From this study, we outline a methodology for system acquisition and use.},

In practice, however, high-level artifacts are often not appropriately captured. This paper presents an approach to capturing and assessing software architectures for evolution and reuse. The approach consists of a framework for modeling various types of relevant information and a set of architectural views for reengineering, analyzing, and comparing software architectures. We have applied this approach to large-scale telecommunications systems, where the approach is useful to reveal areas for improvement and the potential for reuse.},

Especially we use the XML Metadata Interchange Format (XMI) as a tool for the transformation of object-oriented models. We outline XMI based scenarios in the forward and reverse engineering of different applications. As an example, we show how XMI and a standardized XML query/transformation language such as XSLT can be used for the generation of SQL database schemas based on UML models, and for design recovery from legacy code.},

abstract = {Software development that assembles prefabricated components faces different challenges than development that starts from scratch with programming constructs. For example, it is often impossible, or at least not economical, to change the source code of components from independent suppliers. But how do you assemble the components without doing that? How do you link them with the services they require? And how do you build a distributed system and ensure system-wide security, performance, and fault tolerance without breaking the system? These are just some of the issues that designers face when using prefabricated components in a distributed system. Object-oriented distributed systems pose some specific problems. Objects communicate by invoking methods on other objects, so they must maintain static information, such as class or interface names. Thus, objects may have strong dependencies, not only on each other but also on outside services. Distributed systems built from prefabricated components require an assembly approach that separates architecture, component, and distributed object infra-structure concerns.},

Designing an architecture for a product line or long-lived system is difficult because detailed requirements are not known in advance. The ABD method fulfills functional, quality, and business requirements at a level of abstraction that allows for the necessary variation when producing specific products. Its application relies on an understanding of the architectural mechanisms used to achieve this fulfillment.   The method provides a series of steps for designing the conceptual software architecture. The conceptual software architecture provides organization of function, identification of synchronization points for independent threads of control, and allocation of function to processors. The method ends when commitments to classes, processes and operating system threads begin to be made. In addition, one output of the method is a collection of software templates that constrain the implementation of components of different types. The software templates include a description of how components interact with shared services and also include "citizenship" responsibilities for components.},

abstract = {Dependencies in a software project can contribute to unsatisfactory progress if they constrain or block the flow of work. Various studies highlight the importance of dependencies in the organisation of work; however dependencies in agile software development projects have not previously been a research focus. Drawing on three case studies of agile software projects, and the IS literature, this paper develops an initial taxonomy of agile software project dependencies. Three distinct categories of dependency are found: task, resource, and knowledge dependencies. This paper contributes to theory by providing a taxonomy of dependency types occurring in the area of agile software development. Practitioners can use this taxonomy as sensitising device to ensure they consider dependencies they might face that could hinder their projects, enabling them to take appropriate and timely mitigating action.},

It provides an easily understood and amusing account of what took place in computer research between the 1950s and the 1980s. The achievements of those days were later exploited by companies like Apple and Microsoft, which brought personal computers to the consciousness of the general public.During that era ... when both the design of computers and expectations about the ways in which they could be used were undergoing dramatic change ... the author was 'in the trenches' where seminal experiments were taking place, first at MIT and later at other universities and research centers. His unassuming story ... a breezy and irreverent memoir enlivened by amusing anecdotes from his professional and personal experience ... gives a human dimension to the otherwise dry and often obscure process of scientific and engineering innovation. Developments are brought to life and explained in terms that can be understood by anyone. Along the way you'll meet a number of memorable characters who, although often overshadowed in the public mind by entrepreneurs, are widely recognized as pioneers in the field of computer research.},

A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {With increasing complexity of the organisation, data and functions of enterprises, information systems need to be increasingly flexible and extendible, intuitive to interrogate and navigate around and to be interoperable with existing legacy systems. Large scale engineering and scientific projects may, in addition, demand systems which require integration and/or distribution over many separate organisations. The integration of such ‘islands of information', which ultimately forms the basis of so-called ‘virtual enterprises', is heavily dependent on the flexibility and accessibility of the data model describing the enterprise's repository. The model must provide interoperability extendibility and reusability so that a range of applications can access the enterprise data. Making the repository self-describing and based on meta-object structures ensures that knowledge about the repository structure is available for applications to interrogate and to navigate around for the extraction of application-specific data. In this paper, a large application is described which uses a meta-object based repository to capture product and workflow data in an engineering data warehouse.

Architecture models for ESA also have dual purposes. For decision makers, models are integrated abstractions that illustrate the “system of systems” and their interrelationships. IT solution efforts leverage detailed architectural models, referenced to the higher-order “system of systems,” to guide the creation of applications, data, and technological components required to support business and information processes. The fourth component of enterprise architecture (EA), ESA and its associated models are bounded by the common requirements vision (CRV), the conceptual architecture, and the output from enterprise business, information, and technical architecture models.},

abstract = {In the new economic context, based on Information and Knowledge resources, the concepts of Information Systems and Information Technology (IS{\&}IT) are fundamental to understand the organizational and managerial process in all levels: strategic, tactic and operational. From an academic and practitioner perspective, we pose that the correct use of the concept of IS{\&}IT, and in specific of Information Systems, is critical. First ones need to study the same object and second ones need to use the same common conceptual knowledge about what are Information Systems. Nevertheless, uniquely informal and semiformal definitions of Information Systems have been reported in the literature and thus a formal definition based on core systemic foundations is missing. For these reasons, the conceptualization and formal definition of what are Information Systems acquires a relevant research and praxis status. This chapter addresses this problematic situation posing a formal definition of the term Information Systems based on core theoretical principles of the Systems Approach. For that, we firstly review the foundations of Systems Approach to establish the basis for our conceptual development. Then, an updated formal definition of the core concept System originally developed by Gelman and Garcia (1989) and that incorporates new insights from other systemic researchers is presented. With these theoretical bases, we proceed to review the contributions and limitations of main informal and semiformal definitions of the term Information Systems reported at the literature. Then the new formal definition of this term is developed using the updated formal definition of the term System. We continue with a discussion of how the definition posed formalizes systemic concepts of previous definitions, of how these are partial cases of the new definition and of how it can be used to model and study Information Systems in organizations. Finally, we conclude with main remarks and implications of this definition and with directions for further research.},

abstract = {Software development methodologies today do not cover sufficiently the matter of smooth evolution of long-lived software infrastructures, as they, for instance and in our main focus, appear in very large, heterogeneous, distributed information systems. These are based, in general, on several underlying autonomous databases and applications. Change and further development, usually, is driven by new user needs and customer requirements from the top, but also by additional offers of information resources at the bottom level. Our notion of 'continuous software engineering' tries to tackle this challenging task in particular aspects. We suggest a methodology based on three principles: 

(object-oriented) information modeling on the bottom and top layers in parallel, 
making explicit use of metainformation as a basic concept, and, 
componentization in a software-architectural sense. 
Herein, a consistent development of appropriate meta data structures play a central role as well for the analysis steps as also during the design process. Explicit OO models and software components of meta data help in establishing more flexible solutions, for an improved systems evolution.},

The difference between the productivity of individual developers is on the order of 10 to 20 times. The difference between the capability of software development organizations is at least two orders of magnitude greater100 to 200 times. The reason is that organization capability is also affected by the deftness of management, investment in process improvement, the development process employed, and the tools in use. This difference goes a long way toward explaining why some organizations win contracts and complete projects on schedule, within budget, and at satisfactory quality levelsand others don't.},

@article{Conboy2009,
abstract = {A wareness and use of agile methods has grown rapidly among the information systems development (ISD) community in recent years. Like most previous methods, the development and promotion of these methods have been almost entirely driven by practitioners and consultants, with little participation from the research community during the early stages of evolution. While these methods are now the focus of more and more research efforts, most studies are still based on XP, Scrum, and other industry-driven foundations, with little or no conceptual studies of ISD agility in existence. As a result, this study proposes that there are a number of significant conceptual shortcomings with agile methods and the associated literature in its current state, includ-ing a lack of clarity, theoretical glue, parsimony, limited applicability, and naivety regarding the evolution of the concept of agility in fields outside systems development. Furthermore, this has significant implications for practitioners, rendering agile method comparison and many other activities very difficult, especially in instances such as distributed development and large teams that are not conducive to many of the commercial agile meth-ods. This study develops a definition and formative taxonomy of agility in an ISD context, based on a structured literature review of agility across a number of disciplines, including manufacturing and management where the concept originated, matured, and has been applied and tested thoroughly over time. The application of the texonomy in practice is then demonstrated through a series of thought trials conducted in a large multinational organization. The intention is that the definition and taxonomy can then be used as a starting point to study ISD method agility regardless of whether the method is XP or Scrum, agile or traditional, complete or fragmented, out-of-the-box or in-house, used as is or tailored to suit the project context.},

@article{EricWegscheider1997,
abstract = {Conventional wisdom holds that building high-end business applications is unavoidably difficult because applications and the technology for implementing them are complex. Empirical evidence from real projects amply reinforces this conclusion. Building business applications requires technical knowledge about database design, entity relationship or object modeling, GUI design, middleware technology, programming languages, operating systems, prototyping tools, and so on. Pulling together a development environment and a knowledgeable team capable of tackling a large application can be a major hurdle in starting a new project. It can be argued that spiraling technical complexity makes it difficult to focus on the application's core business problem. Complicated prototyping tools may help with early rapid iteration, but they result in throwaway mock-ups that quickly lose sync with the application as it evolves. To reach a new level of productivity and quality in application building, we need something better. This article begins with a simple business application and attempts to sketch out what an "ideal" approach to specifying it might be. From this basic example, design and process patterns emerge that allow for the specification of a comprehensive environment that meets these criteria.},

abstract = {This paper introduces the idea of coding a practically relevant body of knowledge (BoK) in Information Systems (IS) that could have major benefits for the field. In its main part, the paper focuses on the question if and how an underlying body of action-oriented knowledge for IS experts could be distilled from the IS research literature. For this purpose the paper identifies five knowledge areas as the most important parts for an IS expert's BoK. Two of these are claimed as distinct areas of competence for IS experts: IS application knowledge and IS development (ISD) process knowledge. The paper focuses particularly on ISD process knowledge because it allows the organizing of practically relevant IS knowledge in an action-oriented way. The paper presents some evidence for the claim that a considerable body of practically relevant IS process knowledge might, indeed, exist, but also notes that it is highly dispersed in the IS literature. It then argues that the IS research community should take stock of this knowledge and organize it in an action-oriented way. Based on results from prior work it proposes a four-level hierarchical coding scheme for this purpose. In order to test the idea of coding action-oriented knowledge for IS experts, the paper reports the results of a coded literature analysis of ISD research articles published from 1996 to 2000 in two leading IS journals – Information Systems Journal and MIS Quarterly. The results suggest that ISD approaches form a useful framework for organizing practically relevant IS knowledge.},

abstract = {This paper presents the Architecture Based Design (ABD) method for designing the high-level software architecture for a product line or long-lived system. Designing an architecture for a product line or long-lived system is difficult because detailed requirements are not known in advance. The ABD method fulfills functional, quality, and business requirements at a level of abstraction that allows for the necessary variation when producing specific products. Its application relies on an understanding of the architectural mechanisms used to achieve this fulfillment. 

The method provides a series of steps for designing the conceptual software architecture. The conceptual software architecture provides organization of function, identification of synchronization points for independent threads of control, and allocation of function to processors. The method ends when commitments to classes, processes and operating system threads begin to be made. In addition, one output of the method is a collection of software templates that constrain the implementation of components of different types. The software templates include a description of how components interact with shared services and also include "citizenship" responsibilities for components.},

The second method used a different set of clues, such as statistics on database populations, to compute separate similarity metrics (using neural network techniques). We report on substantial use of the first tool, and then report some limited initial experiments that examine the two techniques' accuracy, consistency and complementarity.},

abstract = {A new information system landscape is emerging that will be more
model-centered than object-oriented, characterized by many
models of low granularity and high abstraction, which describe
static or dynamic aspects of enterprise information systems. This
paper focuses more particularly on the organization of dynamic
models that we call here active system frameworks (process
models by opposition to product models). They cover, among
other concerns, the organization of work, its assignment to
potential performers and interactions between them. Agent
technology is thus concerned in two ways. First, as active
elements, they may intervene in a workflow in the same way as
real persons. Second, some of their aspects (organization,
processing and interaction) are also shared by other domains. All
these schemes could and should be organized in a lattice of metamodels.
The point of view taken here is essentially the one of the
software engineering community. As we witness a rapid
proliferation of product and process meta-models, the question of
their overall organization arises. Inspiration may be provided in
this field by some results of ontology engineering. We specifically
point out at two practical areas of concern. First how to couple
the meta-models of process and the meta-models of products.
Second how to organize the various process meta-models involved
in the design and maintenance of information systems.},

abstract = {Agile software development provides a way to organise the complex task of multi-participant soft-ware development while accommodating constant project change. Agile software development is well accepted in the practitioner community but there is little understanding of how such projects achieve effective coordination, which is known to be critical in successful software projects. A theoretical model of coordination in the agile software development context is presented based on empirical data from three cases of co-located agile software development. Many practices in these projects act as coordina-tion mechanisms, which together form a coordination strategy. Coordination strategy in this context has three components: synchronisation, structure, and boundary spanning. Coordination effectiveness has two components: implicit and explicit. The theoretical model of coordination in agile software devel-opment projects proposes that an agile coordination strategy increases coordination effectiveness. This model has application for practitioners who want to select appropriate practices from agile methods to ensure they achieve coordination coverage in their project. For the field of information systems develop-ment, this theory contributes to knowledge of coordination and coordination effectiveness in the context of agile software development.},

Not just is much design activity ridiculed as "Big Up Front Design", but such design techniques as the UML, flexible frameworks, and even patterns are de-emphasized or downright ignored. In fact XP involves a lot of design, but does it in a different way than established software processes. XP has rejuvenated the notion of evolutionary design with practices that allow evolution to become a viable design strategy. It also provides new challenges and skills as designers need to learn how to do a simple design, how to use refactoring to keep a design clean, and how to use patterns in an evolutionary style.

I consider this is to be a good book and a must read for students and practitioners of Organizational Behavior Management. Although much of the information will be familiar, especially to those involved in behavior-based safety, this book still manages to expand our understanding of the critical elements involved in the use of checklists to improve performance. Unfortunately, the empirical data are largely limited to studies in health care. It is too bad that he missed the whole body of literature from behavioral safety as it would have added significantly to his empirical base. In spite of this shortcoming, I found great value in the book. Beyond our implementation efforts, however, my company is now beginning efforts to develop checklists for many of our own complex tasks, including project management and sales. While this is in part due to growth and increased complexity in our organization, it is also partly due to the impact of this book. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)},

Although it does a good job in the early-phase development process, UML does leave some things to be desired in the systems design and implementation phases because it is lacking in structural and behavioral constructs. The author proposes a merger between UML and the Specification and Description Language (SDL) that would enhance UML's usefulness as a graphical programming language. SDL, a language that models the architecture and behavior of event-driven, distributed systems in real-time environments, originated as a specification language within the telecommunications industry approximately 20 years ago. Today, SDL is often used as a full blown programming language. Although UML is headed in a similar direction, combining the two languages provides a modeling paradigm for visual software engineering that is more robust and effective than either language alone.},

@article{Baskerville2001,
abstract = {Regardless of their market niche, most companies feel pressured to release software faster: within 12 to 18 months for non-Internet companies and as quickly as three to six months for Web ventures. To achieve these short cycles, companies like Microsoft and Netscape have adopted techniques that can halve traditional development times: Lean production tailors work processes, tool use, methods, and project management to eliminate waste and rework. Fast cycle time mandates using development processes that require only a fraction of the time and resources ordinary processes consume. As the scramble to innovate reduces development time, companies must seek nontraditional approaches to software quality. Both Microsoft and Netscape, for example, improve quality, reduce costs, and decrease production time on their large projects by applying prototyping techniques perfected on small projects. To identify what drives and characterizes Internet-speed development, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University, Georgia State University, and the Software Engineering Institute interviewed software developers and project managers at nine companies that use these practices. This study, part of an ongoing project, revealed three important trends. Time drives development decisions based on pressures to reach market first. Quality depends on whether or not practices like parallel QA are in place, the importance customers place on quality, and developers' skill levels. Finally, development processes adjust as companies tweak their methods to achieve higher quality.},

Software in 30 Days is for the business manager, the entrepreneur, the product development manager, or IT manager who wants to develop software better and faster than they now believe possible. Learn how this unorthodox process works, how to get started, and how to succeed. Control risk, manage projects, and have your people succeed with simple but profound shifts in the thinking.The authors explain powerful concepts such as the art of the possible, bottom-up intelligence, and why it's good to fail early--all with no risk greater than thirty days. The productivity gain vs traditional "waterfall" methods has been over 100{\%} on many projects Author Ken Schwaber is a co-founder of the Agile software movement, and co-creator, with Jeff Sutherland, of the "Scrum" technique for building software in 30 days Coauthor Jeff Sutherland was cosigner of the Agile Manifesto, which marked the start of the Agile movement Software in 30 Days is a must-read for all managers and business owners who use software in their organizations or in their products and want to stop the cycle of slow, expensive software development.

We propose two strategies for im-proving overall availability using simple mechanisms that scale over large applications whose output behavior toler-ates graceful degradation. We characterize this degradation in terms of harvest and yield, and map it directly onto engi-neering mechanisms that enhance availability by improving fault isolation, and in some cases also simplify program-ming. By collecting examples of related techniques in the literature and illustrating the surprising range of applica-tions that can benefit from these approaches, we hope to motivate a broader research program in this area.},

@article{Sedigh-Ali2001,
abstract = {Large projects rely increasingly on commercial off-the- shelf components, a trend that emphasizes the need for adequate metrics to quantify component quality. Handling the growth of these COTS-based systems requires new approaches to quality and risk management. The authors offer software-engineering metrics to aid developers and managers in analyzing their quality-improvement initiatives' return on investment and to facilitate the modeling of cost and quality. They assert that large-scale component reuse or COTS component acquisition can generate savings in development resources, which can be applied to improve quality and enhance reliability, availability, and maintenance. Further, metrics play a critical role in identifying risks that involve performance, reliability, adaptability, scheduling, and product evaluation. COTS products change rapidly, and research on COTS-based- system development is still in the early stages. Given that cost-effectiveness and quality provide the major factors in deciding for or against component acquisition, the authors see an urgent need for empirical and analytical research that will lead to more accurate cost and quality models for these systems.},

abstract = {The concept of “type” has been used without a precise definition in discussions about programming languages for 20 years. Before the concept of user defined data types was introduced, a definition was not necessary for discussions of specific programming languages. The meaning of the term was implicit in the small list of possible types supported by the language. There was even enough similarity between different languages so that this form of definition allowed discussions of languages in general. The need for a widely accepted definition of type became clear in discussions of languages that allow users to add to the set of possible types without altering the compiler. In such languages, the concept of type is no longer implicitly defined by the set of built-in types. A consistent language must be based on a clearer definition of the notion of type than we now have.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach to program comprehension in multi-language systems. Such systems are characterized by a high amount of source codes in various languages for programming, database definition and job control. Coping with those systems requires the references crossing the language boundaries to be analyzed. Using the EER/GRAL approach to graph-based conceptual modeling, models representing relevant aspects of single language are built and integrated into a common conceptual model. Since conceptual modeling focusses on specific problems, the integrated model presented here is especially tailored to multi-language aspects. Software systems are parsed and represented according to this conceptual model and queried by using a powerful graph query mechanism. This allows multi-language cross references to be easily retrieved. The multi-language conceptual model and the query facilities have been developed in cooperation with the maintenance programmers at an insurance company within the GUPRO project.},

abstract = {A growing number of organizations are implementing the ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library) "best practice" framework in an attempt to improve their IT service management processes. However, not all ITIL implementations are successful and some companies have been disappointed with the outcomes. This exploratory research reports on four case studies of "successful" implementations of IT service management using the process-based ITIL V2 framework. Two companies are located in the U.S. and two in Australia. The cases demonstrate a mix of implementation justifications and strategies. Critical success factors (CSFs) suggested in the literature are compared against those attributed to these successful ITIL implementations. Some CSFs, including executive management support, interdepartmental communication and collaboration, use of consultants, training and careful software selection are confirmed. Three new CSFs are identified: creating an ITIL-friendly culture, process as a priority, and customer-focused metrics. Practitioner guidelines, to assist IT managers, who are contemplating adopting ITIL for process improvement and organisational transformation, are also provided together with some challenges encountered and their associated resolutions.

abstract = {With increasing complexity of the organisation, data and functions of enterprises, information systems need to be increasingly flexible and extendible, intuitive to interrogate and navigate around and to be interoperable with existing legacy systems. Large scale engineering and scientific projects may, in addition, demand systems which require integration and/or distribution over many separate organisations. The integration of such ‘islands of information', which ultimately forms the basis of so-called ‘virtual enterprises', is heavily dependent on the flexibility and accessibility of the data model describing the enterprise's repository. The model must provide interoperability extendibility and reusability so that a range of applications can access the enterprise data. Making the repository self-describing and based on meta-object structures ensures that knowledge about the repository structure is available for applications to interrogate and to navigate around for the extraction of application-specific data. In this paper, a large application is described which uses a meta-object based repository to capture product and workflow data in an engineering data warehouse. It shows that adopting a meta-modelling approach to repository design provides support for interoperability and a suitable environment on which to build enterprise-wide data navigation.},

@inproceedings{Sunbul1999,
abstract = {Software development methodologies today do not cover sufficiently the matter of smooth evolution of long-lived software infrastructures, as they, for instance and in our main focus, appear in very large, heterogeneous, distributed information systems. These are based, in general, on several underlying autonomous databases and applications. Change and further development, usually, is driven by new user needs and customer requirements from the top, but also by additional offers of information resources at the bottom level. Our notion of 'continuous software engineering' tries to tackle this challenging task in particular aspects. We suggest a methodology based on three principles:   (object-oriented) information modeling on the bottom and top layers in parallel,  making explicit use of metainformation as a basic concept, and,  componentization in a software-architectural sense.  Herein, a consistent development of appropriate meta data structures play a central role as well for the analysis steps as also during the design process. Explicit OO models and software components of meta data help in establishing more flexible solutions, for an improved systems evolution.},

We believe a business model can best be described through nine basic building blocks that show the logic of how a company intends to make money. The nine blocks cover the four main areas of a business: customers, o$\Omega$er, infrastructure, and financial viability. The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.},

Series: Johns Hopkins Studies in the History of Technology

Over the course of several decades, the Pentagon's Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) helped transform computing from a cumbersome enterprise based on batch processing to the instantly interactive, graphically rich, highly intelligent computing of today. With the purpose of improving command and control systems for the military, IPTO researchers strengthened time-sharing, laid the groundwork for graphics and parallel processing, contributed to the study of artificial intelligence, and developed the wide-area network that came to be known as the Internet. Transforming Computer Technology examines these and other developments at the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency in its heyday between 1962 and 1986. The authors show how Pentagon programs affected significant developments in both computer science and engineering. They analyze the management of the office, the origins and growth of important IPTO programs, and the interaction of the staff with the R {\&} D community. They pay special attention to IPTO's role in executing research at the leading edge of computing and networking and in working with the military to transfer that research into practical use. And they show how, by the 1990s, the research results had been assimilated into systems both for the military and for civilian society.},
