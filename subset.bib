  abstract =      {"Most startups are built to fail. But those failures,
                   according to entrepreneur Eric Ries, are preventable.
                   Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or
                   missed deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because
                   they are building something nobody wants. Whether
                   they arise from someone's garage or are created
                   within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new
                   ventures, by definition, are designed to create new
                   products or services under conditions of extreme
                   uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out
                   what customers ultimately will buy. One of the
                   central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what
                   Ries calls "validated learning" about the customer.
                   It is a way of getting continuous feedback from
                   customers so that the company can shift directions or
                   alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute.
                   Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a
                   product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing
                   your vision continuously with your customers and
                   making constant adjustments"--},

  title =         {{IT Doesn't Matter}},
  year =          {2003},
  abstract =      {Description: As information technology has grown in
                   power and ubiquity, companies have come to view it as
                   evermore critical to their success; their heavy
                   spending on hardware and software clearly reflects
                   that assumption. Chief executives routinely talk
                   about information technology's strategic value, about
                   how they can use IT to gain a competitive edge. But
                   scarcity, not ubiquity, makes a business resource
                   truly strategic--and allows companies to use it for a
                   sustained competitive advantage. You gain an edge
                   over rivals only by doing something that they can't.
                   IT is the latest in a series of broadly adopted
                   technologies--think of the railroad or the electric
                   generator--that have reshaped industry over the past
                   two centuries. For a brief time, these technologies
                   created powerful opportunities for forward-looking
                   companies. But as their availability increased and
                   their costs decreased, they became commodity inputs.
                   From a strategic standpoint, they no longer mattered.
                   That's exactly what's happening to IT, and the
                   implications are profound. In this article, HBR's
                   Editor-at-Large Nicholas Carr suggests that IT
                   management should, frankly, become boring. It should
                   focus on reducing risks, not increasing
                   opportunities. For example, companies need to pay
                   more attention to ensuring network and data security.
                   Even more important, they need to manage IT costs
                   more aggressively. IT may not help you gain a
                   strategic advantage, but it could easily put you at a
                   cost disadvantage.},

                   Management In "Agile Product Management with Scrum,
                   leading Scrum consultant Roman Pichler uses
                   real-world examples to demonstrate how product owners
                   can create successful products with Scrum. He
                   describes a broad range of agile product management
                   practices, including making agile product discovery
                   work, taking advantage of emergent requirements,
                   creating the minimal marketable product, leveraging
                   early customer feedback, and working closely with the
                   development team. Benefitting from Pichler's
                   extensive experience, you'll learn how Scrum product
                   ownership differs from traditional product management
                   and how to avoid and overcome the common challenges
                   that Scrum product owners face. Coverage includes
                   Understanding the product owner's role: what product
                   owners do, how they do it, and the surprising
                   implications Envisioning the product: creating a

                   manage-ment with high availability is highly
                   magnified by the un-precedented scale and robustness
                   requirements of today's Internet applications. We
                   propose two strategies for im-proving overall
                   availability using simple mechanisms that scale over
                   large applications whose output behavior toler-ates
                   graceful degradation. We characterize this
                   degradation in terms of harvest and yield, and map it
                   directly onto engi-neering mechanisms that enhance
                   availability by improving fault isolation, and in
                   some cases also simplify program-ming. By collecting
                   examples of related techniques in the literature and
                   illustrating the surprising range of applica-tions
                   that can benefit from these approaches, we hope to
                   motivate a broader research program in this area.},

                   Development}},
  year =          {2012},
  abstract =      {Dependencies in a software project can contribute to
                   unsatisfactory progress if they constrain or block
                   the flow of work. Various studies highlight the
                   importance of dependencies in the organisation of
                   work; however dependencies in agile software
                   development projects have not previously been a
                   research focus. Drawing on three case studies of
                   agile software projects, and the IS literature, this
                   paper develops an initial taxonomy of agile software
                   project dependencies. Three distinct categories of
                   dependency are found: task, resource, and knowledge
                   dependencies. This paper contributes to theory by
                   providing a taxonomy of dependency types occurring in
                   the area of agile software development. Practitioners
                   can use this taxonomy as sensitising device to ensure
                   they consider dependencies they might face that could
                   hinder their projects, enabling them to take
                   appropriate and timely mitigating action.},

  volume =        {26},
  year =          {1994},
  abstract =      {This survey characterizes an emerging research area,
                   sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on
                   the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research
                   in this area uses and extends ideas about
                   coordination from disciplines such as computer
                   science, organization theory, operations research,
                   economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight
                   of the framework presented here is that coordination
                   can be seen as the process of managing dependencies
                   among activities. Further progress, therefore, should
                   be possible by characterizing different kinds of
                   dependencies and identifying the coordination
                   processes that can be used to manage them. A variety
                   of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and
                   commonalities across disciplines are identified.
                   Processes analyzed include those for managing shared
                   resources, producer/consumer relationships,
                   simultaneity constraints, and tank/subtask
                   dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a
                   coordination perspective in three different domains:
                   (1) understanding the effects of information
                   technology on human organizations and markets, (2)
                   designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing
                   distributed and parallel computer systems. In the
                   final section, elements of a research agenda in this
                   new area are briefly outlined.},

  abstract =      {Agile software development provides a way to organise
                   the complex task of multi-participant soft-ware
                   development while accommodating constant project
                   change. Agile software development is well accepted
                   in the practitioner community but there is little
                   understanding of how such projects achieve effective
                   coordination, which is known to be critical in
                   successful software projects. A theoretical model of
                   coordination in the agile software development
                   context is presented based on empirical data from
                   three cases of co-located agile software development.
                   Many practices in these projects act as coordina-tion
                   mechanisms, which together form a coordination
                   strategy. Coordination strategy in this context has
                   three components: synchronisation, structure, and
                   boundary spanning. Coordination effectiveness has two
                   components: implicit and explicit. The theoretical
                   model of coordination in agile software devel-opment
                   projects proposes that an agile coordination strategy
                   increases coordination effectiveness. This model has
                   application for practitioners who want to select
                   appropriate practices from agile methods to ensure
                   they achieve coordination coverage in their project.
                   For the field of information systems develop-ment,
                   this theory contributes to knowledge of coordination
                   and coordination effectiveness in the context of
                   agile software development.},

                   subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms Agency theory
                   is an important, yet controversial, theory. This
                   paper reviews agency theory, its contributions to
                   organization theory, and the extant empirical work
                   and develops testable propositions. The conclusions
                   are that agency theory (a) offers unique insight into
                   in-formation systems, outcome uncertainty,
                   incentives, and risk and (b)},

  year =          {2007},
  abstract =      {Software developers are rooted in the written form of
                   their code, yet they often draw diagrams representing
                   their code. Unfortunately, we still know little about
                   how and why they create these diagrams, and so there
                   is little research to inform the design of visual
                   tools to support developers' work. This paper
                   presents findings from semi-structured interviews
                   that have been validated with a structured survey.
                   Results show that most of the diagrams had a
                   transient nature because of the high cost of changing
                   whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings.
                   Diagrams that documented design decisions were often
                   externalized in these temporary drawings and then
                   subsequently lost. Current visualization tools and
                   the software development practices that we observed
                   do not solve these issues, but these results suggest
                   several directions for future research.},

  abstract =      {For many that come briefly into contact with Extreme
                   Programming, it seems that XP calls for the death of
                   software design. Not just is much design activity
                   ridiculed as "Big Up Front Design", but such design
                   techniques as the UML, flexible frameworks, and even
                   patterns are de-emphasized or downright ignored. In
                   fact XP involves a lot of design, but does it in a
                   different way than established software processes. XP
                   has rejuvenated the notion of evolutionary design
                   with practices that allow evolution to become a
                   viable design strategy. It also provides new
                   challenges and skills as designers need to learn how
                   to do a simple design, how to use refactoring to keep
                   a design clean, and how to use patterns in an
                   evolutionary style.},

  abstract =      {With increasing size and complexity of the
                   implementations of information systems, it is
                   necessary to use some logical construct (or
                   architecture) for defining and controlling the
                   interfaces and the integration of all of the
                   components of the system. This paper defines
                   information systems architecture by creating a
                   descriptive framework from disciplines quite
                   independent of Information systems, Men by analogy
                   specifies Information systems architecture based upon
                   the neutral, objective framework. Also, some
                   preliminary conclusions about the implications of the
                   resultant descriptive framework are drawn. The
                   discussion is limited to architecture end does not
                   include a strategic planning methodology.},
