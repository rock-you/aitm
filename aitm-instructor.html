<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Agile IT Management is a perfect fit for my Management Information Systems class to introduce students to the fast-paced world of IT Infrastructure that they will be dealing with shortly upon graduation.  This book uses multiple perspectives (Founder, Team Leader, VP, C-level executive) to demonstrate to the student not only how a business grows, but how they need to continually grow their skill set.  The use of hands-on exercises encouraged by the format of this book complements my teaching style that allows students to learn by doing, failing and doing again.  An additional benefit is that this book begins with a focus on the startup mentality which I will use in my Business Innovation class.</em></p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2013, I was approached by Dr. Bhabani Misra, the head of the Graduate Programs in Software at the University of St. Thomas in St. Paul. Dr. Misra asked me to teach an "IT Infrastructure" course (SEIS660), focusing on the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, or ITIL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first semester of the class was well received enough for me to be invited back. However, there were complaints from the students that it was too "theoretical." I was attempting to teach using an enterprise architecture style, with lots of abstractions, that just was not engaging students effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I also had a team project approach that immediately started the students out as the IT leadership team of a large corporation. This generated feedback that the students wanted something more practical; they were not going to be immediately hired as senior executives!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I took this feedback seriously. I especially gave thought to a practical aspect, and so started to develop a lab component. This was and is popular with the students. I also started to think about different approaches for structuring the class that would make more sense for a survey class with a wide spectrum of experience.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For three semesters I assigned my first book (<em>Architecture and Patterns for IT: Service Management, Resource Planning, and Governance</em>) as a required text for the class. However, I did not write this as a textbook and its limitations became clearer and clearer. It has a strongly architectural approach, approaching the IT management problem as a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4%2B1_architectural_view_model">views on a model</a>. I do not recommend this as a pedagogical approach for a survey class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I approached my publisher with the idea of a 3rd edition that would pivot the existing material towards being something more useful in class. They agreed to this and I started the rewrite.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, by the time I was halfway done with the first draft, I had a completely new book. Material from the previous work simply did not fit the emergence model used to structure the narrative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A number of factors converged at this point:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>My view that the "medium is the message" and this extends to choice of authoring approach, intellectual property, DRM, and publisher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contacts with local and international faculty and thought leaders, and a desire to openly collaborate with them on making the book as good as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A desire to freely share at least a rough version of the book, both for marketing purposes and in the interests of giving back to the global IT community</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A desire to be able to rapidly update the book with as little friction as possible</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A practical realization that the book might get more uptake globally if available at least in some form as free and open source IP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The fact I had already started to <a href="https://github.com/StThomas-SEIS660">publish my labs on Github</a>, and had in fact had developed a workable continuous delivery ("DevOps") toolchain (the <a href="https://github.com/CharlesTBetz/Calavera">Calavera project</a>, which has attracted collaborators from the US, Spain, and Israel).</p>

<p>Welcome to Agile IT Management: From Startup to Enterprise. So, what exactly IS this textbook, anyhow?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It is the first general, survey-level text on IT management with a specific Agile, Lean IT, and DevOps orientation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has a unique and innovative narrative structure based on the concept of organizational evolution and scaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It both covers and is written using Agile, Lean, and continuous delivery techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Because it is written with continuous integration and print on demand techniques, it can be continually updated to reflect current industry trends.</p>

<p>[W]e&#8217;ve moved to a flatter organizational model with "teams of teams" who are focused on outcomes. These are colocated groups of people who own a small, minimal viable product deliverable that they can produce in 90 days. The team focuses on one piece of work that they will own through its complete lifecycle…in [the “back office”] model, the CIO controls infrastructure, the network, storage, and makes the PCs run.

<p>Modern Information Systems texts, especially at the undergraduate, survey level, take an "outside-in" approach to the course material, seeking to orient <strong>all</strong> students (whether IT/MIS specialists or not) as to the role and function of information systems and their possibilities and value in the modern enterprise. This book, by contrast, is an "inside-out" book, intended to prepare the student for a career in digital industry. “Industry” is broadly defined as both those industries that offer digital products <em>per se</em>, as well as industries that rely on digital technology instrumentally for delivering all kinds of products. A central theme of the book is that “IT,” considered as a component, represents an increasing proportion of ALL industrial products (both consumer and business facing). This is known as "digital transformation."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Current MIS survey texts have some common characteristics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>They tend to focus on the largest organizations, and their applications of computing. This can lead to puzzling topic choices; for example, in one text, one of the first sections is dedicated to the problem of enterprise IT asset management - a narrow topic for the earlier sections of a survey course, and increasingly irrelevant in the age of Cloud.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their learning progression (structure and narrative) is often arbitrary, e.g., covering "databases," "networking," "ERP systems," "security," and so forth in various orderings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They do not (and this is a primary failing) cover Agile and its associated digital ecosystem at all well. Brief mentions of Agile may appear in sections on project management, but in general there is a lack of awareness of the fundamental characteristics of digital transformation, and the critical role of Agile and related methods to accelerating digital transformation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their coverage of Cloud infrastructure also tends to be limited, even with new editions coming out every year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, current texts often uncritically accept and cite "best practice" IT frameworks such as CMMI, ITIL, PMBOK, and COBIT. New digital organizations do not, in general, use such guidance and the industry at this writing is rife with controversy as to the value and future of these frameworks. This book provides a clear and objective overview of these critical issues.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT, or the digital function, has had a history of being under-managed and poorly understood relative to peer functions in the enterprise. It struggles with a reputation for expensive inflexibility and Dilbert-esque dysfunction. The DevOps and Agile movements promise transformation, but are encountering an entrenched legacy of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>enterprise architecture,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>program and project management,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>business process management,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT service management practices, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT governance concerns</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding and engaging with the challenges of this legacy are an ongoing theme throughout this introductory text. Some of the more radical voices in the Agile movement sometimes give the impression that the legacy can be simply swept away. The following cautionary message from Mike Burrows shows that, in terms of core Agile philosophy, this would be ill-advised:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>“…some will tell you that when things are this bad, you throw it all away and start again. It&#8217;s ironic: The same people who would champion incremental and evolutionary approaches to product development seem only too eager to recommend disruptive and revolutionary changes in people-based systems – in which the outcomes are so much less certain.”</em> <a href="#Burrows2014">[Burrows2014]</a>, Kindle Locations 827-829.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT management at scale within an organization is a complex system. The IT workforce and its ongoing development (through education and training) is another complex system orders of magnitude larger. Complex systems do not respond well to dramatic perturbations. They are best changed incrementally, with careful monitoring of the consequences of each small change. (This is part of the systems theory foundation underlying the Agile movement.) This is why the book, especially in the later chapters, starts with relatively straightforward and uncritical presentations of the following topics:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Investment, sourcing, and people</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project and process management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Governance, risk, security, and compliance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise information management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise architecture and portfolio management</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While these practices, and their associated approaches and policies, have caused friction with digital and Agile practitioners, they all have their reasons for existing. The goal of this book is to understand their interaction with the new digital approaches, but in order to do this we must first understand them on their own terms. It does no good to develop a critique based on misconceptions or exaggerations about what (for example) "process management" or "governance" is all about. Instead, we try to break these large and sometimes controversial topics down into smaller, more specific topics - "lowest common denominators," perhaps:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Work and effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ordering of tasks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Task dependencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Planned versus unplanned work</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estimation versus commitment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value stream versus skill alignment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeatability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defined versus empirical process control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Synchronization and cadence</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resource demand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shared mental models</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mission objectives versus perimeter defense</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technical debt</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Risk</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and so forth. By examining IT management in these more neutral, specific terms, we can develop a responsible critique of current industry "best practices" in content and form that will benefit students as they go out on their careers.</p>

<blockquote>
Joseph Campbell popularized the notion of an archetypal journey that recurs in the mythologies and religions of cultures around the world. From Moses and the burning bush to Luke Skywalker meeting Obi wan Kenobi, the journey always begins with a hero who hears a calling to a quest&#8230;&#8203;<br>
<br>
The hero’s journey is an apt way to think of startups. All new companies and new products begin with an almost mythological vision— a hope of what could be, with a goal few others can see&#8230;&#8203; <br>
<br>
Most entrepreneurs feel their journey is unique. Yet what Campbell perceived about the mythological hero’s journey is true of startups as well: However dissimilar the stories may be in detail, their outline is always the same.

<p>One of the most important and distinguishing features of this book is its "emergence model." In keeping with the entrepreneurial spirit of works like Ries' <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0307887898/"><em>The Lean Startup</em>,</a> the book adopts a progressive, evolutionary approach. The student&#8217;s journey through it reflects a process of emergence. Such processes are often associated with founding and scaling a startup. There are many helpful books on this topic, such as:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The emergence model and overall book structure is discussed in depth in the main introduction. Here for the instructor are some notes on the thought process. I have spent considerable time thinking (agonizing) about the correct ordering of the chapters within these sections. This is possibly the tenth or twelfth version of the chapter ordering. This is an area where I want critical review, but also have strong opinions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is benefit to restricting the chapters to 12, as a typical semester runs 14 weeks and the book then fits quite nicely, with one chapter per class and allowing for an introductory session and final exam. (Trying to modfiy the semester system is out of scope for this project.) Of course, a two-semester series, with 2 weeks per chapter, would also work well; each half of the book is also a logical unit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The governing thought experiment is, "what would I turn my attention to next as my IT-based concerns scale up?" For example, I think work management (implying rudimentary workflow, e.g. Kanban) correctly comes before formalized project and/or process management, which in turn tend to emergence before enterprise governance practices (e.g. formalized risk management).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that this would be a testable and falsifiable hypothesis, if empirical research were done to inventory and characterize organization scaling patterns. If we found (for example) that a majority of organizations formalize governance, risk, security and compliance practices before formalizing project management, that would indicate that those chapters should be re-ordered. In my experience, small/medium businesses may have some formal IT project management capability but governance, risk, and compliance  are still tacit, not formalized. This does not mean that GRC is not a concern, but they have not yet instituted formal policy management, internal audit, or controls.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The presence of Product Management at an early stage is intended to provoke. Product management is poorly addressed in most current CSci/MIS/IT education, as well as the reigning industry standards. Yet formalizing it is one of the earliest concerns for a startup, and the imperatives of the product vision drive all that comes after. Evidence to this effect is seen (as of 2015) at the University of California at Berkeley I-School, which has replaced its Project Management course with <a href="http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i290m-lapm">Lean/Agile Product Management</a>, taught currently by the esteemed Jez Humble, author of <em>Continuous Delivery</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, you may notice that <strong>the chapter titles don&#8217;t necessarily reflect "Agile" terminology</strong>. This is also deliberate, as students are going into a diverse world of much long-established IT. Furthermore, putting "Agile" as a qualifier on each chapter seems gratuitous (e.g. "Agile Operations Management" instead of just "Operations Management.") The first word of the book&#8217;s title is "Agile." That declares the orientation, and the proof will be in the reading. My intent is to involve experienced Agile practitioners in contributing to the sections most relevant to them, and I anticipate a high quality end result that is recognizably supportive of the Agile movement&#8217;s goals and ambitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book however is not a complete dismissal of older models of IT delivery. Wherever possible, Agile is presented as an evolutionary step relative to what has gone before. The specifics of "what&#8217;s different" are identified, in the interest of de-mystifying what can be a fraught and quasi-religious topic. In the words of Don Reinertsen, you can have "faith based Agile or science based Agile." This book is strictly interested in the latter. Pointers to relevant theory are included, although this is NOT a theoretical text. That may come later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This emergence model can also be understood as an individual&#8217;s progression within a larger enterprise.</strong> Even if one starts from Day 1 at a Fortune 100 corporation, I believe the progression of one&#8217;s understanding still progresses through individual, to team, to "team of teams," to enterprise. Of course, one may cease evolving one&#8217;s understanding at any of these stages, with corresponding implications for one&#8217;s career.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of you may be familiar with the idea of a Minimum Viable Product, Minimum Marketable Release, or similar. In these terms, it is important to understand that each <strong>section</strong> of the book represents an MVP, but not each chapter. One can&#8217;t begin to deliver IT value without the components discussed in each of Chapters 1-3. The chapters of each section tend to be interdependent, in other words.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each chapter flows in a roughly "top-down" fashion:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>"Business" concerns (value, motivation)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Process" concerns (execution, flow)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lean, Agile, and DevOps perspectives as appropriate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"System" concerns (information &amp; automation)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book does not cover specific technologies in any depth. Many examples are used, but carefully framed to not require previous expertise. This is about broader, longer-lifecycle trends.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_labs">Labs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With three chapters in each section, the book can be covered in one intense semester at a chapter a week, although expanding it to a two-semester treatment would allow for more in-depth coverage and increased lab exposure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I give great credit to both my first cohort of students and Dr. Bhabani Misra for challenging me to add a practical component to the course. This required new thinking on my part. How to demonstrate IT management at scale in a lab setting? I have learned that a hands on component is critical, as IT management discussions can be  abstract and meaningless to many students. (”Incidents are different from Problems!”)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ten years ago, the best that would have been possible would be paper case studies, perhaps augmented with spreadsheets. But new options are now available. The power of modern computers (even lightweight laptops) coupled with the widespread availability of open source software, makes it is now possible to expose students to industrial computing in a meaningful, experiential way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have found great utility in the use of lightweight virtualization technologies such as Vagrant, Virtualbox and Docker.  I recommend this approach wholeheartedly. I am always interested in hearing from other instructors who are working from the same approach. At this writing I maintain my labs publicly on Github.  My syllabus and lab structure is under continual improvement. This is my current aspirational plan.</p>

<p>I use a central server in teaching my classes, but even that is not necessary. This class can be taught with a zero computing budget, assuming that each team of students at least has access to a modern laptop and a fast Internet connection.

<p>Some may question the inclusion of command-line experience, but without some common technical platform it is hard to provide a meaningful “hands-on” experience in the first half of the course.

Not even a programming language is required; the Java currently used as a sample is minimal.</p>

<p>Truly beginning students will have to work at the Linux tutorials, but all they need master is basic command line navigation, and I have found this possible with a diverse student body, some with no previous direct experience.

<h3 id="_for_the_student">For the student</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a "survey" text intended for the advanced undergraduate or graduate student interested in the general field of applied IT management. It is grounded in basic computing fundamentals, but does not require any particular technical skills to understand. You do not need to have taken any courses in networking, security, or particular programming languages to read this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, you will be presented with material on such topics, including fragments of programming languages and pseudocode, and need to be willing to invest the time and effort to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book makes frequent reference to digital startups - early stage companies bringing new  products to market that are primarily delivered as some form of computer-based service. Whether or not you intend to pursue such endeavors, the startup journey is a powerful one for your learning. Large information technology organizations in enterprises sometimes gain a reputation for losing sight of business value. IT seems to be acquired and operated for its own sake. Statements like "we need to align IT with the business!" are too often heard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A digital startup exposes with great clarity the linkage between "IT" and "the business." The success or failure of the company itself depends on the adept and responsive creation and deployment of the software-based systems. Market revenues arrive, or do not, based on digital product strategy and the priorities chosen. Features the market doesn&#8217;t need? You won&#8217;t have the money to stay in business. Great features, but your product is unstable and unreliable? Your customers will go to the competition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The lessons that digital entrepreneurs have learned through this trial by fire shed great light on IT&#8217;s value to the business. Thinking about a startup allows us to consider the most fundamental principles as a sort of microcosm, a small laboratory model of the same problems that the largest enterprises face.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this is not a textbook (or course) on entrepreneurship. It remains IT-centric. <strong>And, the book is also intended to be relevant to students entering directly into large, established enterprises.</strong> In fact, it prepares the student for working in all stages of growth because it progresses through these four contexts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Individual (founder)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team</p>

<p>Small company (team of teams)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether in a startup, or on a journey within a larger, established organization, you will (hopefully) become aware as you progress through a broadening context:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Other team members</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This book is written at the advanced undergraduate/graduate student level. It is currently available only in English.</p>

<li>
<p>There is no assumption of deep IT experience, but there is an assumption that the person interacts with computers in some capacity and has basic technical literacy. They should for example understand the concept of an "operating system." An A+ certification, or an intro to programming class for example, would more than adequately prepare someone for this book.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A person completely unfamiliar with computing will need to supplement their reading as suggested throughout the text. There is a wealth of free and accurate information on IT fundamentals (e.g. compute, storage, networking, programming, etc) and this book seeks more to curate than replicate.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_emergence_means_formalization">Emergence means formalization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The emergence model seeks to define a likely order in which concerns are <strong>formalized</strong>. Any concern may of course arise at any time: the startup founder certainly is concerned with security!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Formalization means at least one or more of the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dedicated resources</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dedicated organization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defined policies and processes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Automated tooling</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the author&#8217;s experience, for example, startups avoid formalized process and project management. To the extent the concerns exist, they are <em>tacit</em> (understood or implied; suggested; implicit). Certainly, a small startup does not invest in an enterprise-class service desk tool supporting a full array of IT management processes, or a full-blown Project Management Office with its own Vice President and associated portfolio automation. Simple work management, with a manual or automated Kanban board, is likely their choice for work management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But by the time they are a team of teams, specialization has emerged and more robust processes and tools are required. The danger of course is that the formalization effort may be driven by its own logic, and start to lose track of the all-critical business context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By careful examining these stages of maturation, and the industry responses to them, it is the author&#8217;s hope that the student will have effective tools to critically engage with the problem of scaling the digital organization.</p>

This is the introduction to Part I.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we  explore the fundamentals of information technology delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are working in a startup, alone or with one or two partners. You are always in the same room, easily able to carry on a running conversation about your efforts and progress. You have no time or resources to spend on anything except keeping your new system alive and running.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 1: IT Value</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chapter 1 introduces you to the fundamental concepts of IT value that serve as a basis for the rest of the course. Why do people want computing (IT) services? What are the general outlines of their structure? How do they come into being? How are they changed over time?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this is essential to understand for your scenario; you need to understand what computers can do and how they are generally used, if you are going to create a product based on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter also covers the basics of how you&#8217;ll approach building a product. It&#8217;s assumed you won&#8217;t develop an intricate, long-range plan but rather will be experimenting with various ideas and looking for "fast feedback" on their success or failure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 2: IT Infrastructure</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, you have a general idea for a product and are ready to start building it. But not so fast&#8230;&#8203; you need to decide some fundamentals first. How will your new product run? What will you use to build it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not possible to begin construction until you decide on your tools. This chapter will provide you an overview of computing infrastructure including Cloud hosting and various approaches to system configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This chapter also presents an overview of source control, as even your infrastructure depends on it in the new world of "infrastructure as code."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Application delivery</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you&#8217;re ready to start building something. While this is not a book on software development or programming languages, it&#8217;s important to understand some basics and at least see them in action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also the "DevOps" chapter; it&#8217;s not just about writing code, but about the entire end to end system that gets the code you are writing from your workstation, into collaborative environments, and finally to a state where it can be accessed by end users. From source repository to build manager to package repository to production, we&#8217;ll cover a basic toolchain that will help you understand modern industrial practices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This section&#8217;s lab approach</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this is not a book about any particular computing language or platform, we need to describe some technical fundamentals. We’ll do so in as neutral a manner as possible. However, this books’ accompanying labs are based on <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Linux</a> and <a href="https://git-scm.com/">git</a>, the distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds to facilitate Linux development.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_introduction">Introduction</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted at the outset, you are a small core of a startup. You are building a product of which IT is a significant part (otherwise why are you reading this book/in this class?) Your motivations are entrepreneurial; you want to create a successful business. You might be housed within a larger enterprise, but the thought experiment here is that you have substantial autonomy to order your efforts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You want to do something that has a unique IT component. Regardless of your business, you will need accounting and legal services at a minimum, and very quickly payroll and HR, and so forth. Those things can (and should) be purchased as commodity services, if you are a small entrepreneur (I am not aware of any convincing arguments to the contrary, unless you are absolutely on the smallest of shoestring budgets and can work 100 hour weeks). Your unique value proposition will be expressed to some degree in unique IT software. While this software may be based on well understood products, the configuration and logic you construct will be all your own. Because of this, you are now a producer (or soon to be) of IT services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we can talk about building and managing information technology (IT), we need to understand what it is and why people want it. We&#8217;ll start this chapter by looking at an IT value experience that may seem very familiar. Then we&#8217;ll dig further into concepts like the "IT stack" and the "IT service" and how they change over time.</p>

<p>This is an introductory text. You may see terms below that are unfamiliar (Model-View-Controller, IP, packet switching). If you are reading this online, you can follow the links, but it&#8217;s not required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you progress in your career, you will always be encountering new terminology. Part of what you need to learn is when it&#8217;s important to dig into it, and when you can let it pass for a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should be able to understand the gist presented below that these are complex systems based on a wide variety of technologies, some of them old, some new.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The screen on her cell phone represents information accessed and presented via a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller framework</a>, implemented in the latest version of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">Javascript</a>, running on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing)">interpreter</a> that would have taxed a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer">mainframe</a> thirty years ago. The communication with her bank’s central systems is supported by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTE_(telecommunication)">4G LTE</a> data which in turn relies on the high-volume <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP backbone</a> networks operated by the <a href="http://searchnetworking.techtarget.com/definition/telecom-carrier">telecommunications carriers</a>, based on research into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packet_switching">packet switching</a> now approaching 50 years old.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application operating on the cell phone interacts with core banking systems via sophisticated and highly secure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middleware">middleware</a>, crossing multiple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">network</a> control points. This middleware talks in turn to the customer demand deposit system that still runs on the mainframe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mainframe is now running the latest version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z/OS">IBM’s zOS</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system">operating system</a> (a direct descendant of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/360_and_successors#MVT">OS/360</a>, one of the most  significant operating systems in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing">history of computing</a>). The "customer demand deposit" banking application running on the mainframe is still based on code written in the lowest level <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembler</a>. Some of the comments in this code date back to the 1970s. It has been tuned and optimized over the decades into a system of remarkable speed and efficiency. Although replatforming it is periodically discussed, the cost/benefit ratio for such a project has to date not been favorable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reservation system looks similar on the mobile device, but the network routes it to a large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud</a> data center hosting the reservation system. The back end application here is very different from the banking system; the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language">programming languages</a> are newer, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a> is structured very differently, and the operating system is <a href="https://www.linux.com/">Linux</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the navigation software looks much like the reservation system, as it too is based on the Cloud. However, the system is much more active, as it is continually processing inputs from millions of drivers in thousands of cities, and updating traffic maps for those drivers in real time so that they can choose the most optimal route to their destinations (e.g., dinner). The capabilities of this system are comparable to an air traffic control system, and yet it is available as a free download for our IT user.</p>

<p>The resulting value is clear:</p>

<p>In an earlier era, our user might have stayed in, for fear of bouncing a check, or might have gone out and dined beyond her means.</p>

<h5 id="_various_forms_of_it_value">Various forms of IT value</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we have seen, there are many ways in which digital systems deliver value. Some systems serve as the modern equivalent of file cabinets: massive and secure storage for financial transactions, insurance records, medical records, and the like. Other systems enable the transmission of information around the globe, whether as emails, web pages, voice calls, video on demand, or data to be displayed in a smart phone application ("app"). Some of these systems support engaged online communities and social interactions, with conversations, media sharing, and even massive online gaming ecosystems. Yet other systems enable penetrating analysis and insight, by examining the volumes of data contained in the first two kinds of systems for patterns and trends. Sophisticated statistical techniques and cutting edge approaches like neural network-based machine learning increase the insights our digital systems are capable of, at a seemingly exponential rate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital technology generates value in both direct and indirect ways. People have long consumed (and paid for) communication services, such as telephone services. Broadcast entertainment was a different proposition, however. The "consumer" - the person with the radio or television - was not the "customer" - the person paying for the programming to go out over the airwaves. New business models sprung up to support the new media, through the sale of advertising air time. In other words, the value proposition was indirect, or at least took multiple parties to achieve: the listener, the broadcaster, and the advertiser. Finally, some of the best known uses of digital technology were and are very indirect - the above-mentioned banks and insurance agencies using the earliest computers to automate the work of thousands of typists and file clerks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From these early business models have evolved and blossomed myriads of creative applications of digital technology, for the benefit of human beings in their ongoing pursuit of happiness and security. We see the applications mentioned at the outset: online banking, messaging, restaurant reservation, and traffic systems. Beyond that we see the use of digital technology in nearly every aspect of life. (And I say "nearly" only because I am a cautious person.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital and information technology pervades all of the major industry verticals (manufacturing, agriculture, finance, retail, healthcare, transportation, services, and so on) and common industry functions (supply chain, human resources, corporate finance, and even IT itself).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital systems and technologies also are critical components of larger scale industrial, military, and aerospace systems. For better or worse, general purpose computers are increasingly found controlling safety-critical infrastructure, and serving as an intermediating layer between human actions and machine response. Robotic systems are based on software, and the Internet of Things ultimately will span billions of sensors and controllers in interconnected webs monitoring and adjusting all forms of complex operations across the planet.</p>

<h5 id="_what_is_it_anyways">What is IT, anyways?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve started this book in the previous section by providing an example of digital or IT value, without much discussion of how it is delivered. This is deliberate. But what is IT (Information Technology), anyways?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The computers? The networks?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The people who run them?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That organization under a Chief Information Officer that loves to say “no” and is always slow and expensive?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>None of these are how this book defines “IT.” Although this is not a technical book on computer science or software engineering, the intent is that it reflects and is compatible with foundational principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Information technology” is ultimately based on the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon">Claude Shannon</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing">Alan Turing</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a>, and the other pioneers who defined the central problems of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory">information theory</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics">digital logic</a>,  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computability">computability</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_architecture">computer architecture</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="1.01.02-IT-as-function-2"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, as an organizational function, information technology also draws on organizational theory, systems theory, human factors and psychology, and more recent concepts such as design thinking, among many other areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussions of “information technology” become contentious because some think of the traditional organization, while others think of the general problem area. IT has a long history as a corporate function, a single hierarchy under a powerful Chief Information Officer. This model has had its dysfunctions, including a longstanding reputation for being slow and expensive. Often, when one encounters the term “IT,” the author using the term is referring to this organizational tradition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>We are less interested in the future of IT as a distinct organizational structure. There are many different models, from fully centralized to fully embedded.</strong> Organizational structure will be discussed in Chapter 7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this book, we define “Information technology” in terms of its historic origins. We look to IT’s common origins in automating the laborious and error prone processes of computation, through the application of digital logic technologies based on information transmission.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of organizational form or delivery methods, IT is defined by these origins. And there are notable common threads throughout this problem domain: the fragility and complexity of these systems, the need for layered abstractions in their management, and more.</p>

<p>It does not matter if the application developers ultimately report up through the CIO, the CMO, the CFO, or the COO. Their daily experience remains largely the same. The dynamics of their management remain the same. Executives who seek to take control of IT so they can “remove that old bureaucracy” are well advised to be cautious; the bureaucracy emerged for a reason. More on this in subsequent chapters.</p>

<p>IT increasingly permeates business operations and social interactions. The breadth and depth of IT support for virtually all domains of society continues to expand. Lately, this is known as digital transformation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The role of information technology seems critical to society and the economy, but there are various points of view. Nicholas Carr, in his controversial <em>Harvard Business Review</em> article "IT Doesn&#8217;t Matter," recognized that IT was becoming commoditized in an important sense <a href="#Carr2003">[Carr2003]</a>. As Cloud providers started to offer utility-style computing, the choice of particular vendors of computers was no longer strategic. Looking to history, Carr argued that just as businesses no longer have “Vice Presidents for Electricity,” so businesses no longer need Chief Information Officers or dedicated IT departments.</p>

A "commodity" product is one that is offered from a variety of suppliers, with little or no difference between their offerings. Commodity products tend to compete on price, not on differences in features. Wheat is a commodity. Sports cars are not. "Commoditization" is the process by which products that used to compete by being different, increasingly compete on price.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Carr has insight&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;there is no question IT is becoming pervasive&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but he ultimately reflects a narrow view of what “IT” is. If “IT” were merely computation at the lowest level&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just shuffling bits of information around, doing a little math&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;then perhaps it could be embedded throughout a business like electricity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But IT has emergent aspects that are not comparable to electrical power. As it pervades all dimensions of business operations, it brings its concerns with it: complexity, fragility, and the skills required to cope with them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One watt of electrical power is like any other watt of electrical power, and can usefully be seen as a commodity. We can use it to run toasters, hair dryers, or industrial paint mixers, and there is little concern (beyond supply and demand management) that the consumption of power by the paint mixer will affect the toaster.  It&#8217;s also true that one cycle of computing, in a certain sense, is like any other cycle. But information technology systems interact with each other in surprising and unpredictable ways, orders of magnitude more complex than electrical power grids. (This is not to imply the modern electrical grid is a simple system!)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT also radically transforms industries: from retail to transportation to manufacturing to genetics. Applied software-centric IT is unleashing remarkable economic disruption.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lawyer may depend on a cell phone, and (in keeping with Carr) beyond its provision as a commodity service, needs little else to deliver the legal strategies a firm needs. A graphic designer may use computerized graphic tools, but these have become relatively standardized and commoditized in the past twenty years, and probably are not a source of competitive advantage in the quest for new marketing clients.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, consider a text analytic algorithm that replaces thousands of paralegals, resulting in order-of-magnitude more accurate legal research in a fraction of cost and time. This <strong>is</strong> strategic and disruptive to the legal community. A superior supply chain algorithm, and the ability to improve it on an ongoing basis, may indeed elevate a logistics firm’s performance above competitors. In cases like these&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and they seem to be increasing&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;IT matters very much.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the digitally transforming economy, traditional “back office” IT organizations find themselves called on to envision, develop, and support market-facing applications of IT. And what starts with one market-facing use case can quickly expand into entire portfolios.  It is such cases that are of particular concern in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, it is possible that IT is the <strong>most</strong> strategic capability an organization can invest in. As the editor in chief of <em>IEEE Software</em> notes <a href="#Spinellis2015">[Spinellis2015]</a>,</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
other industries are also producing what’s in effect software (executable knowledge) but not treating it as such . . . Although many industries have developed their own highly effective processes over the years, software engineering maintains an essential advantage. It has developed methods and tools that let even small teams manage extremely high complexity . . . This advantage is important because the complexity in non-software activities is also increasing inexorably . . . [T]he time has come to transform our world… by giving back to science and technology the knowledge software engineering has produced.

<h5 id="_defining_it">Defining "IT"</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, how do we define an IT problem, as opposed to other kinds of business problems? An IT problem is any problem where you are primarily constrained by your capability and understanding of IT.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you need computer scientists or engineers who understand the fundamentals of information theory and computer science, you are doing IT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need people who understand when your information-centric problems might need to be referred to such theorists and engineers, you are likely doing IT.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need people who are skilled in building upon those fundamentals, and operating technical platforms derived from them (such as programming languages, general purpose computers, and network routers), you are doing IT.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of whether IT is housed under a traditional CIO, an operations capability, a Chief Marketing Officer, or a “line of business”, when it is critical to operations certain concerns inevitably follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Requirements (i.e. your intent for IT)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sourcing and provisioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IT-centric product design and construction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Configuration and change management</p>

<li>
<p>Support</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvement</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Executives who take control of information technology in hopes of making it more "agile" are often surprised to find that these concerns were not mere bureaucracy, but instead had well grounded origins in past failures. Ignoring these lessons is perilous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And yet, the traditional, process-heavy IT organization does seem dysfunctional from a business point of view: a central theme of this book.

<p>Let&#8217;s examine our diner&#8217;s value experience in more detail, without getting unnecessarily technical, and clarify some definitions along the way.  The first idea we need to cover is the "moment of truth." In terms of information technnology, this English-language cliché represents the user&#8217;s experience of value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the example, our friend seeking a relaxing night out had several moments of truth:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consulting her bank balance, and subsequent financial transactions also reflecting what was stated to her</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making a reservation and having it honored on arrival at the restaurant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arriving on time to the restaurant, courtesy of the traffic application</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And most importantly, having a relaxed and refreshing time with her friends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these individual value experiences was co-created by our friend&#8217;s desire for value, and the response of a set of IT resources.</p>

<p>In order to view her balance, our user is probably using an application downloaded from a "store" of applications made available to her device. On her device, this "app" is part of an intricate set of components performing functions such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>accepting "input" (user intent) through a screen or voice input</p>

<p>receiving that information and converting it to a form that can be represented on a screeen</p>

<li>
<p>finally, displaying the information on the screen</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, without the banking systems on the other end, there is no bank balance to transmit. These systems are similar, but on a much larger scale than our friend&#8217;s device:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Internet and middleware services to receive the request from the international network</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Application services to validate the user&#8217;s identity and route the request to the appropriate handling service</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data services to store the user&#8217;s banking information (account identity and transactions) along with millions of other customers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many additional services to detect fraud and security attacks, report on utilization, identify any errors in the systems, and much more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical data centers full of computers and associated hardware including massive power and cooling infrastructure, and protected by security systems and personnel.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Therefore, as we study this world, we need to maintain awareness of her perspective. Our friend is seeking some value that IT uniquely can enable, but does not want to consider all the complexity that goes into it. She just wants to go out with friends. The moment of truth depends on the service; the service may contain great complexity, but part of its success lies in shielding the user from that complexity.</p>

<p>In general, in this book, we will use the following definitions:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An IT service is defined primarily in terms of WHAT not HOW</p>

<p>Defining an IT system may include a discussion of both WHAT it does and HOW it does it</p>

<li>
<p>An "application" usually means some IT service or system for end users who are not primarily concerned with IT other than wanting to get something done with it (e.g. go out to dinner)</p>

<li>
<p>"Infrastructure" usually means some IT service or system that primarily supports OTHER IT services or systems (e.g. a network "service" is not usually useful to end users without additional application services.)</p>

<p>Finally, the concept of the "IT stack" is important. Notice how the different technology layers appear "stacked." Layered approaches to understanding IT are common; see Further Reading for useful references.</p>

<div class="title">Author&#8217;s note: Service versus product</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purposes of this book, "IT services" are equivalent to "products." You may in other contexts hear phrases like "products <strong>versus</strong> services" which imply that they are distinct. Usually, when products are contrasted with services, people are equating products with goods: a jar of peanut butter is a "product," while a haircut is a service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when I worked at AT&amp;T, the internal term for offerings like broadband networking access was not "service," but "product." Services, in this sense, <strong>are</strong> products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this book, we see products and services as roughly equivalent, but the two terms have some different connotations. Products usually imply an external market, where services can be either internal or external facing. While we certainly talk about "product marketing", the term "service marketing" is rarely seen. Furthermore,  some organizations such as Target have recently re-conceptualized internal services organizations as "product teams."</p>

<h4 id="service-lifecycle">The IT service lifecycle</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="service-lifecycle"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve established that the IT service is based on a complex stack of technology, from local devices to global networks to massive data centers. Software and hardware are layered together in endlessly inventive ways to solve problems people did not even know they had ten years ago.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But these IT service systems must come from somewhere. They must be designed, built, and operated, and (as any smartphone user can testify) they are continually improved over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple representation of the IT service lifecycle is shown in the figure below.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>It starts with an idea. Someone has an insight into an IT-enabled value proposition that can make a profit, or better fulfill a mission.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea must garner support and resources so that it can be built.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The idea is then constructed, at least as an initial proof of concept or Minimum Viable Product (in the language of Ries' <em>Lean Startup</em>.) Construction is assumed to include an element of design; in this textbook, <strong>construction and design are not represented as two separate phases.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a critical state transition however that will always exist. Initially, it is the change from OFF to ON when the system is first constructed. After the system is ON, there are still distinct changes in state when new features are deployed, or incorrect behaviors ("bugs" or "defects") are rectified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system may be ON, but it is not delivering value until the user can access it. Sometimes, that may be as simple as providing someone with a network address, but usually there is some initial "provisioning" of system access to the user, who needs to identify themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system can then deliver services (moments of truth) to the end users. It may deliver millions or billions of such experiences, depending on its scale and how one might choose to count the subjective concept of value experience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The user may have access, but may still not receive value, if they do not understand the system well enough to use it. Whether via a formal service desk, or informal social media channels, users of IT services will require and seek support on how to maximize the value they are receiving from the system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes, support requests indicate that something is wrong with the system itself. If the system is no longer delivering value experiences (bank balances, restaurant reservations, traffic directions) then some action must be taken promptly to restore service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All of the previous states in the lifecycle generate data and insight that lead to further evolution of the system. There is a wide variety of ways systems may evolve: new user functionality, more stable technology, increased system capacity, and more. Such motivations result in new construction and changes to the existing system, and so the cycle begins again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&#8230;&#8203;Unless&#8230;&#8203; the system&#8217;s time is at an end. If there is no reason for the system to exist any longer, it should be retired.</p>

<h4 id="consumer-customer-sponsor">Defining consumer, customer, and sponsor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="consumer-customer-sponsor"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In understanding IT value, it is essential to clarify the definitions of user, customer, and sponsor, and understand their perspectives and motivations. Sometimes, the user <strong>is</strong> the customer. But more often, the user and the customer are different, and one may additionally need to distinguish the role of system or service sponsor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following definitions may help</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <strong>consumer</strong> (sometimes called the <strong>user</strong>) is the person actually interacting with the IT-based service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>customer</strong> is a source of revenue for the service. If the service is part of a profit center, the customer is the person actually purchasing the product (e.g. demand deposit banking.) If the service is part of a cost center (e.g. an HR system), the customer is best seen as an internal executive, as the actual revenue-producing customers are too far removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>sponsor</strong> is the person who authorizes and controls the funding used to construct and operate the service.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the service type, these roles can be filled by the same or different people. Here are some examples:</p>

The bank experiences less customer turnover and increased likelihood that customers add additional services. The restaurant sees increased traffic and smoother flow from more efficient reservations. Both see increased competitiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The traffic application is a somewhat different story. While it is an engineering marvel, there is still some question as to how to fund it long term. It requires a large user base to operate, and yet end consumers of the service are unlikely to pay for it. At this writing, the service draws on advertising dollars from businesses wishing to advertise to passersby, and also sells its real-time data on traffic patterns to a variety of customers, such as developers considering investments along given routes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This last example well illustrates the maxim that "if you don&#8217;t know how the product is making money, you are the product."</p>

<p><strong>IT exists in a social context</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like the proverbial fish that doesn&#8217;t understand water (because water it all it knows), we may lose sight of the laws and customs that enable us to use computers in the ways covered in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the ability for banks to hold money as electronic bits on a computer is rooted in the earliest history of banking and the emergence of centralized settlement and clearing mechanisms. Cell phone companies rely on international treaties, and national laws and regulations allocating radio spectrum.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The existence of physical voice and data connectivity relies on laws supporting utility easements and rights of way, and even treaties such as the Law of the Sea (how is it that undersea cables remain unmolested?).</p>

<p>As you consider embarking on a journey of IT value, you need to orient to your surroundings and create an initial proposal or plan for how you will proceed. If you are actually a startup, you need a business plan. If you are working as an intrapreneur in a larger organization, you will still need some kind of formal proposal. This section describes some tools and thinking approaches that may be useful at this very earliest stage. There are more focused, product-specific techniques in the chapter section on <a href="#prod-discovery-techniques">product discovery techniques</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_market_facing_supporting_back_office">Market facing, supporting, back office</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Chapter 1 we discussed the question of "who pays/who benefits" for the service, <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_consumer_customer_and_sponsor">proposing that</a> the service consumer, the service customer, and the service sponsor might be three distinct roles (sometimes collapsing into 2 or 1 individual.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see this again in how we can categorize the "customers" of IT services and systems. Roughly, such services can be:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Directly market- and consumer-facing (e.g. Facebook), to be used by external consumers and paid for by either them or closely associated customers (e.g. Netflix, or an online banking system).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customer "supporting" systems, such as the online system that a bank teller uses when interacting with a customer. Customers do not interact directly with such systems, but customer-facing representatives do, and problems with such systems may be readily apparent to the end customer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completely "back-office" systems (HR, payroll, marketing, etc)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note however, that (especially in the current digitally transforming market) a service previously thought of as "back office" (when run internally) becomes "market-facing" when developed as a profit-seeking offering. For example, an HR system built internally is "back office," but Workday is a directly market-facing product, even though the two services may be similar in functionality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s all relative.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Especially when products are <strong>not</strong> market facing, we start to run into the problem of distinguishing <a href="#discovery-v-design">discovery versus design</a>, as we discuss below.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_diffusion_theory_and_other_approaches">Diffusion theory and other approaches</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you start to think about digital value, you must think about the context for your startup or product idea. What is the likelihood of its being adopted? Is it part of a broader "movement" of technological innovation? Where is the customer base in terms of its willingness to adopt the innovation? A well known approach is the idea of the "diffusion theory," first researched by Everett Rogers and proposed in his <em>Diffusion of Innovations,</em> <a href="#Rogers2003">[Rogers2003]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rogers' research proposed the idea of "Adopter Categorization on the Basis of Innovativeness," with a well-known graphic:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="float: right">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.01a-adoption.png" alt="diffusion-graph" width="500">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rogers went on to characterize the various stages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Innovators: Venturesome risk-takers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early adopters: Opinion leaders</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Early majority: Deliberative, numerous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late majority: Skeptical, also numerous</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laggards: Traditional, isolated, conservative</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above figure was popularized in the following variation by Geoffrey Moore <a href="#Moore2014">[Moore2014]</a> in his bestseller <em>Crossing the Chasm</em>:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll see this diagram often, but you should be aware that Rogers himself (the person who has researched the data) says that (p.282):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Past research shows no support for this claim of a “chasm” between certain adopter categories. On the contrary, innovativeness, if measured properly, is a continuous variable and there are no sharp breaks or discontinuities between adjacent adopter categories (although there are important differences between them)</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea of technology diffusion frames the problem for us, but we need more. Steve Blank, in his influential book <em>The Four Steps to Epiphany</em> <a href="#Blank2013">[Blank2013]</a>, argues there are four categories for startups (p.31):</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Startups that are entering an existing market</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Startups that are creating an entirely new market</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Startups that want to re-segment an existing market as a low-cost entrant</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Startups that want to re-segment an existing market as a niche player</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding which category you are attempting is critical, because "the four types of startups have very different rates of customer adoption and acceptance."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another related and well known categorization of competitive strategies comes from Michael Treacy and Fred Wiersma <a href="#Treacy1997">[Treacy1997]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Customer intimacy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product leadership</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operational excellence</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not difficult to categorize well known brands in this way:</p>

<p>In this chapter, we discussed the basic questions of information technology value and how it is experienced and developed.

We considered the user&#8217;s moment of truth, and the massive IT complexity that sustains it. We also discussed a high level lifecycle model for IT applications and services, and explored some initial definitions for user, customer, and sponsor - critical distinctions to make in an age of digital transformation.</p>

<p>As mentioned in the Part Introduction, you cannot start developing a product until you decide what you will build it with. (You may have a difficult time writing an app for a mobile phone if you choose the COBOL programming language!)  You also need to understand something of how computers are operated, enough so that you can make decisions on how your system will run. Most startups choose to run IT services on infrastructure owned by a Cloud provider, but there are other options.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the previous chapter, you were introduced to the concept of a Moment of Truth, and in the final exercises asked to think of a product idea. Some part of that product requires writing software, or at least configuring some IT-centric system. (IT being defined as in <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_information_technology">Chapter 1</a>.) You presumably have some resources (time and money). It’s Monday morning, you have cleared all distractions, shut down your Twitter and Facebook feeds, and are ready to start building.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not so fast.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you can start writing code, you need some kind of a platform. It&#8217;s hard to build before you decide on your tools. You need to decide what language you are going to write in, or what framework you are going to configure, and how that effort is going to result in an operational system capable of rendering IT services. You are probably swimming in a sea of advice and options regarding your technical choices. In previous decades, books such as this might have gone into the specifics of particular platforms: mainframe vs. minicomputers, COBOL vs Fortran, Windows vs Unix, etc.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this writing, JavaScript is a leading choice, in conjunction with various frameworks and NoSQL options (e.g. the MEAN stack, for MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js), but millions of developers are still writing Java and .Net, and Ruby and Python have significant followings. Linux is arguably the leading platform, but commercial Unix and Microsoft platforms are still strong. And, periodically it&#8217;s reported that the majority of the world&#8217;s transactions <strong>still</strong> run on <a href="http://blog.hackerrank.com/the-inevitable-return-of-cobol/">COBOL-based systems</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in the past few years, some powerful infrastructure concepts have solidified that are independent of particular platforms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Automation and “infrastructure as code”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The centrality of source control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The importance of package management</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Policy-based infrastructure management</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(We&#8217;ll get to test-driven development, pipeline automation &amp; DevOps in the next chapter.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might seem like a detour - you are in a hurry to start writing code! But industry practice is clear. You check your code into source control from Day One. You define your server configurations as recipes, manifests, or at least shell scripts, and check those definitions into source control as well. You keep track of what you have downloaded from the Internet and what version of stuff you are using, through package management (which uses different tools than source control). Always downloading the “latest” package from its upstream creator might seem like the way to stay current, but it will kill you when stuff works on one server but not on another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, you need to understand a few things and make a few decisions that you will be living with for a while, and will not be easily changed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Infrastructure is a tricky word. Google defines it thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>￼<em>The basic physical and organizational structures and facilities (e.g., buildings, roads, and power supplies) needed for the operation of a society or enterprise.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, it connotes the stuff behind the scenes, the things you need but don’t want to spend a lot of time thinking about. We will spend a lot of time examining what we mean by “infrastructure” in this book, as it is fundamental to understanding the “business of IT.” This book defines “IT infrastructure” recursively as “the set of IT concerns that are of particular interest to IT.”</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An application or business service is consumed by people who are NOT primarily concerned with IT. For example, a customer-facing online banking service is consumed by end users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An IT infrastructure service is a service consumed by other IT-centric teams and capabilities. For example, a database or a load balancing service is consumed by other IT teams.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT infrastructure is one form of infrastructure. Other kinds of infrastructure might include mechanical, electrical, and plant investments (ME &amp; P). IT infrastructure, like IT itself, is defined by its fundamental dependence on information and computing theory [link Chapter 1].</p>

Today’s application becomes tomorrow’s infrastructure. Forty years ago, building an “application” would have included building its database, perhaps even its file management. This was rightly determined to be a general-case problem that could be the basis for commodity software, and so companies like Oracle were born.<br>
<br>
Operating systems took on more and more functionality, technology became more and more reliable and easily configured, and once unique (and competitively differentiating) functionality became commoditized and more and more deeply buried in the “stack”: the IT infrastructure.

<p>There are many books (some in the Further Reading section for this chapter) on all aspects of IT infrastructure, which is a broad and deep topic. Our discussion of it here has to be high level, as appropriate for a survey course. We&#8217;ve established <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_defining_information_technology">what we mean by IT generally</a>.

<p>Computing cycles (sometimes called just "compute")</p>

<p>If we have a picture of our friend, and we use a digital filter to adjust the brightness, that is an application of compute power. The picture is made up of "pixels" which are nothing but numbers representing the color of some tiny square of the picture. Each of those numbers needs to be evaluated and the brightness adjusted. There may be millions in a single image.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that the pixel values range from 1 to 10, with 1 being the darkest and 10 being the lightest (in reality, the range is much larger.) To brighten a picture, we might tell the computer:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">

<p>Computers process instructions at the level of "true" and "false," represented as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number">binary</a> "1s" and "0s."

<p>Computer processing is not free. Moving data from one point to another - the fundamental <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transmission">transmission of information</a> - requires matter and energy, and is bound up in physical reality and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics">laws of thermodynamics</a>. The same applies for changing the state of data, which usually involves moving it somewhere, operating on it, and returning it to its original location. In the real world, even running the simplest calculation has physical and therefore economic cost, and so we must pay for computing.</p>

<p><strong>Storage</strong> But where did the picture come from? The data comprising the pixels needs to be stored somewhere. Sometimes you will hear the technical term "persisted." The combined set of pixels and their precise values can be termed the "state" of the photograph; the digital logic of the filter alters the state, and also needs to save this new state somewhere (otherwise it will be lost).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many technologies <a href="http://www.zetta.net/history-of-computer-storage/">have been used for digital storage.</a> Increasingly, the IT professional need not be concerned with the physical infrastructure used for storing data. As we will cover in the next section, storage increasingly is experienced as a virtual resource, accessed through executing programmed logic on Cloud platforms. "Underneath the covers" the Cloud provider might be using various forms of storage, from RAM to solid state drives to tapes, but the end user is,  <strong>ideally</strong>, shielded from the implementation details (part of the definition of a service).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is important to understand that in general, storage follows a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hierarchy">hierarchy</a>. Just as we might "store" a document by holding it in our hands, setting it on a desktop, filing it in a cabinet, or archiving it in a banker&#8217;s box in an offsite warehouse, so computer storage also has different levels of speed and accessibility:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On-chip registers and cache</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Random-access memory (RAM), aka "main memory"</p>

<p><strong>Network</strong>
We can change the state of some data, or store it. We also need to move it. This is the basic concern of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_network">networking</a>, to transmit data (or information) from one location to another. If you use your cell phone to look up your bank balance, there is network involved - otherwise, how did the data get from the bank&#8217;s computer in New Jersey to your cell phone in Minnesota? We see evidence of networking every day; you may be familiar with coaxial cables for TV, or telephone lines strung from pole to pole in many areas. However, like storage, there is also a hierarchy of networking:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Intra-chip pathways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard">Motherboard</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane">backplane</a> circuits</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And like storage and compute, networking as a service increasingly is independent of implementation. The developer uses programmatic tools to define expected information transmission, and (again <strong>ideally</strong>) need not be concerned with the specific networking technologies or architectures serving their needs.</p>

<p>As a startup, it would seem likely that you would use a commodity cloud provider. This text is based on this assumption (physical IT asset management will be discussed in Sections 3 and 4), but is there any reason why that would not work for you? The two questions are related. If you want to develop on a LAMP stack, you need a Cloud provider that will support you in this. While most are very flexible, you will need to consider the specific support levels they are offering; a provider that supports the platform (and not just the operating system) might be more valuable, but there may be higher costs and other tradeoffs. There is a near-infinite amount of material, debate, discussion, books, blogs, lists, and so forth concerning choice of language and platform. Exploring this area is not the purpose of this book. However, this book has certain assumptions:</p>

<div class="ulist">

<p>Your system will be built, at least in part, with some form of programming language which is human-readable and compiled or interpreted into binary instructions.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Your computing environment is networked in a standard way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You use the concept of a software pipeline, in which new functionality is developed in a scope distinct from what is currently offered as your product/service.</p>

<p>Let’s be clear, in defining a product (Chapter 1) you already have started to think about requirements, although we have not yet started to use that term.

With the emergence of Cloud providers able to sell computing services, companies no longer need to commit to large capital outlays. And digital product professionals realize that requirements are never fully "understood" up front (more on this in the next chapter). Your Minimum Marketable Feature is an initial statement of requirements from which you should be able to infer at least initial toolset and platform requirements.

<p>Ruby on Rails is another frequently-encountered platform. If you are building a data or analytics-centric product, there are other alternatives as well. There is a good reason, however, why you should not spend too much time “analyzing” before you make platform decisions. The reality is that you cannot know all of the factors necessary to make a perfect decision, and in fact the way you will learn them is by moving forward and testing out various approaches. So, choose Ruby on Rails, or LAMP, or MEAN, and a hosting provider who supports them, and start. You can easily stand up environments for comparison using Cloud services, or even with lightweight virtualization on your own personal laptop. Do not fall into analysis paralysis.

(It has applicability to storage and networking as well but we will skip that for now.) In order to understand this, we need to understand a little bit about operating systems and how they relate to the physical computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assume a simple, physical computer such as a laptop. When the laptop is first turned on, the operating system (OS) loads; the OS is itself software, but is able to directly control the computer&#8217;s physical resources: its central processing unit (CPU), memory, screen, and any interfaces such as WiFi, USB, and Bluetooth. The operating system (in a traditional approach) then is used to run "applications" such as Web browsers, media players, word processors, spreadsheets, and the like. Many such programs can also be run as applications within the browser, but the browser still needs to be run as an application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the simplest form of virtualization, a specialized application known as a <em>hypervisor</em> is loaded like any other application. The purpose of this hypervisor is to emulate the hardware computer in software. Once the hypervisor is running, it can emulate any number of "virtual" computers, each of which can have its own operating system. The hypervisor mediates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine">virtual machine</a> (VM) access to the actual, physical hardware of the laptop; the VM can take input from the USB port, and output to the Bluetooth interface, just like the master OS that launched when the laptop was turned on.</p>

<p>There are two different kinds of hypervisors. The example we just discussed was an example of a Type 2 hypervisor, which runs on top of a host operating system. In a Type 1 hypervisor, a master host OS is not used; the hypervisor runs on the "bare metal" of the computer and in turn "hosts" multiple VMs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Paravirtualization</em>, e.g. containers, is another form of virtualization found in the marketplace. In a paravirtualized environment, a core operating system is able to abstract hardware resources for multiple virtual guest environments without having to virtualize hardware for each guest. The benefit of this type of virtualization is increased input/output (I/O) efficiency and performance for each of the guest environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, while hypervisors can support a diverse array of virtual machines with different operating systems on a single computing node, guest environments in a paravirtualized system generally share a single OS.</p>

Because of configuration issues (legitimate) and an overabundance of caution (questionable), average utilization in a pre-virtualization data center might average 10-20%. (That&#8217;s 90% of the computer&#8217;s capacity being wasted.)</p>

<p>The above figure is a simplification. Computing and storage infrastructure supporting each application stack in the business were sized to support each workload. For example, a payroll server might run on a different infrastructure configuration than a data warehouse server. Large enterprises needed to support hundreds of different infrastructure configurations, increasing maintenance and support costs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The adoption of virtualization allowed businesses to compress multiple application workloads onto a smaller number of physical servers:</p>

<p>In most virtualized architectures, the physical servers supporting workloads share a consistent configuration, which made it easy to add and remove resources from the environment. The virtual machines may still vary greatly in configuration, but the fact of virtualization makes managing that easier - the virtual machines can be easily copied and moved, and increasingly can be defined as a form of code (see next section).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Virtualization thus introduced a new design pattern into the enterprise where computing and storage infrastructure became commoditized building blocks supporting an ever-increasing array of services. But what about where the application is large and virtualization is mostly overhead? Virtualization still may make sense in terms of management consistency and ease of system recovery.</p>

<p>Companies have always sought alternatives to owning their own computers.  is a long tradition of managed services, where applications are built out by a customer and then their management is outsourced to a third party. Using fractions of mainframe "time-sharing" systems is a practice that dates back decades. However, such relationships took effort to set up and manage, and might even require bringing physical tapes to the third party (sometimes called a "service bureau.") Fixed price commitments were usually high (the customer had to guarantee to spend X dollars.) Such relationships left much to be desired in terms of  responsiveness to change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As computers became cheaper, companies increasingly acquired their own data centers, investing large amounts of capital in high-technology spaces with extensive power and cooling infrastructure. This was the trend through the late 1980s to about 2010, when Cloud computing started to provide a realistic alternative with true "pay as you go" pricing, analogous to electric metering.</p>

<p>The idea of running IT completely as a utility service goes back at least to 1965 and the publication of <em>The Challenge of the Computer Utility</em>, by Douglas Parkhill. While the conceptual idea of Cloud and utility computing was foreseeable fifty years ago, it took many years of hard-won IT evolution to support the vision. Reliable hardware of exponentially increasing performance, robust open-source software, Internet backbones of massive speed and capacity, and many other factors converged towards this end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, people store data - often private - on computers. In order to deliver compute as a utility, it is essential to segregate each customer&#8217;s workload from all others. This is called <em>multi-tenancy</em>. In multi-tenancy, multiple customers share physical resources that provide the illusion of being dedicated.</p>

<p>In order to run compute as a utility, multi-tenancy was essential. This is different from electricity (but similar to the phone system).

<p>Virtualization is necessary, but not sufficient for cloud. True Cloud services are highly automated, and most Cloud analysts will insist that if virtual machines cannot be created and configured in a completely automated fashion, the service is not true Cloud.

<blockquote>
Infrastructure as code is an approach to infrastructure automation based on practices from software development. It emphasizes consistent, repeatable routines for provisioning and changing systems and their configuration. Changes are made to definitions and then rolled out to systems through unattended processes that include thorough validation. The premise is that modern tooling can treat infrastructure as if it were software and data. This allows people to apply software development tools such as version control systems (VCS), automated testing libraries, and deployment orchestration to manage infrastructure. It also opens the door to exploit development practices such as test-driven development (TDD), continuous integration (CI), and continuous delivery (CD).

<cite>Infrastructure as Code: Managing Servers in the Cloud</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is infrastructure as code?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As cloud infrastructures have scaled, there has been an increasing need to configure many servers identically. Auto-scaling (adding more servers in response to increasing load) has become a widely used strategy as well. Both call for increased automation in the provisioning of IT infrastructure. It is simply not possible for a human being to be hands on at all times in configuring and enabling such infrastructures, so automation is called for.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In years past, infrastructure administrators relied on ad-hoc issuance of commands either at an operations console, or via a GUI-based application. Shell scripts might be used for various repetitive processes, but administrators by tradition and culture were empowered to issue arbitrary commands to alter the state of the running system directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following passage from The Phoenix Project captures some of the issues. The speaker is Wes, the infrastructure manager, who is discussing a troubleshooting scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>“Several months ago, we were three hours into a Sev 1 outage, and we bent over backward not to escalate to Brent. But eventually, we got to a point where we were just out of ideas, and we were starting to make things worse. So, we put Brent on the problem.” He shakes his head, recalling the memory, “He sat down at the keyboard, and it’s like he went into this trance. Ten minutes later, the problem is fixed. Everyone is happy and relieved that the system came back up. But then someone asked, ‘How did you do it?’ And I swear to God, Brent just looked back at him blankly and said, ‘I have no idea. I just did it.’”</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#Kim2013">[Kim2013]</a>, p. 116.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Obviously, “close your eyes and go into a trance” is not a repeatable process. It is not a procedure or operation that can be archived and distributed across multiple servers. So, shell scripts or more advanced forms of automation are written and increasingly, all actual server configuration is based on such pre-developed specification. It is becoming more and more rare for a systems administrator to actually “log in” to a server and execute configuration-changing commands in an ad-hoc manner (as Brent).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, because virtualization is becoming so powerful, servers increasingly are destroyed and rebuilt at the first sign of any trouble. In this way, it is certain that the server’s configuration is as intended. This again is a relatively new practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Previously, because of the expense and complexity of bare-metal servers, and the cost of having them offline, great pains were taken to fix troubled servers. Systems administrators would spend hours or days troubleshooting obscure configuration problems, such as residual settings left by removed software. Certain servers might start to develop “personalities.” Industry practice has changed dramatically here since around 2010.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In presenting infrastructure as code at its simplest, we will start with the concept of a shell script. While this is not a deep Linux book (there are many others out there, starting with the excellent O’Reilly lineup), some basic technical literacy is assumed in this book. Consider the following set of commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ mkdir foo bar
$ cd foo
$ touch x y z
$ cd ../bar
$ touch a b c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this do? It tells the computer:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Create (<code>mkdir</code>) two directories, one named foo and one named bar.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move (<code>cd</code>) to the one named foo</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create (<code>touch</code>) three files, named x, y, and z</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move to the directory named bar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create three blank files, named a, b, and c.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find yourself (with the appropriate permissions) at a Unix command prompt, and run those commands, you will wind up with a configuration that could be visualized as this:</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.02-iac.png" alt="folders/files" width="300">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>(If you don’t understand this, you should probably spend a couple hours with a Linux tutorial).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configuration, you ask? Something this trivial? Yes, directory and file layouts count as configuration and in some cases are critical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, what if we take that same set of commands, and put them in a file thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>#!/bin/bash
mkdir foo bar
cd foo
touch x y z
cd ../bar
touch a b c</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We might name that file <code>iac.sh</code>, set its permissions correctly, and run it (so that the computer executes all the commands for us, rather than us running them one at a time at the console).  If we did so in an empty directory, we’d again wind up with that same configuration. (If we did it in a directory already containing foo and bar directories, we’d get errors. More on this to come.)</p>

<p>This will be familiar material to many of you, including the fact that beyond creating directories and files we can use shell scripts to create and destroy virtual servers, install and remove software, set up and delete users, check on the status of running processes, and much more.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sophisticated infrastructure as code techniques are are essential part of modern site reliability engineering practices such as used by Google. Auto-scaling, self-healing systems, fast deployments of new features all require that infrastructure be represented as code for maximum speed and reliability of creation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s return to our iac.sh file. It’s valuable. It documents our intentions for how this configuration should look. We can reliably run it on thousands of machines and it will always give us two directories and six files. In terms of the previous section, we might choose to run it on every new server we create. We want to establish it as a known resource in our technical ecosystem. This is where version control and the broader concept of configuration management come in.</p>

<div class="title">Cattle not pets?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In earlier times, servers (that is, computers managed on a distributed network) were usually configured without virtualization. They arrived (carefully packed on pallets) from the manufacturer unconfigured, and would be painstakingly "built" by the systems administrator: the operating system would be compiled and installed, key software packages (such as Java) installed, and then the organization&#8217;s customer software installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At best, the systems administrators, or server engineers, might have written guidelines or perhaps some shell scripts that would be run on the server to configure it in a semi-consistent way. But that documentation would often be out of date, the scripts would be unique to a given administrator, and there would be great reluctance to "rebuild the box" - that is, to delete everything on it and do a "clean re-install." Instead, if there were problems, the administrator would try to fix the server by going in and adjusting particular settings (typically by changing configuration files and restarting services), or deleting software packages and re-installing them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with this is that modern computing systems are so complex that deleting software can be difficult; if the un-install process fails in some way, the server can be left in a compromised state. Similarly, one-time configuration adjustments made to one server means that it may be inconsistent with similar devices, and this can cause problems. For example, if the first systems administrator is on vacation, their substitute may expect the server to be configured in a certain way and make adjustments that have unexpected effects. Or the first systems administrator themselves may forget exactly what it is they did. Through such practices, servers would start to develop personalities, because their configurations were inconsistent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As people started to work more and more with virtualization, they realized it was easier to rebuild virtual servers from scratch, rather than trying to fix them. Automated configuration management tools helped by promoting a consistent process for rebuilding. Randy Bias, noting this, put forth the provocative idea that "servers are cattle, not pets" <a href="#Bias2012">[Bias2012]</a>. That is, when a pet is sick, one takes it to the vet, but a sick cow might simply  be taken out and shot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I prefer the saying that "servers are fleet vehicles, not collectible cars" as it seems less cruel, and Bias overlooked the fact that large animal veterinarians are routinely employed in the cattle industry.</p>

<p>The Agile Alliance indicates “version control” as one of the <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/subway.html">four foundational areas of Agile</a>, along with team, iterative development, and incremental development. Why is this? Version control is critical for any kind of system with complex, changing content, especially when many people are working on that content. Version control provides the capability of seeing the exact sequence of a complex system&#8217;s evolution and isolating any particular moment in its history, or providing detailed analysis on how two versions differ. With version control, we can understand what changed and when, which is essential to coping with complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While version control was always deemed important for software artifacts, it has only recently become the preferred paradigm for managing infrastructure state as well.  Because of this, version control is possibly the first IT management system you should acquire and implement (perhaps as a cloud service, such as Github).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version control in recent years increasingly distinguishes between source and package management: the management of binary files, as distinct from human-understandable symbolic files. There is also a need to understand what versions are installed on what computers; this can be termed "deployment management." (With the advent of containers, this is a particularly fast changing area.)</p>

<p>Version control works like an advanced file system with a memory. (Actual file systems that do this are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Versioning_file_system"><em>versioning</em></a> file systems.) It can remember all the changes you make to its contents, tell you the differences between any two versions, and also bring back the version you had at any point in time. Version control is important - but how important? Survey research presented in the annual State of DevOps report indicates that version control is one of the most critical practices associated with high performing IT organizations <a href="#Forsgren2016">[Forsgren2016]</a>. Nicole Forsgren <a href="#Forsgren2016a">[Forsgren2016a]</a>  summarizes the practice of version control as:</p>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_source_control">Source control</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Digital systems start with text files, typically encoded in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a>. Text editors create source code, scripts, and configuration files. These may be transformed in defined ways (e.g. by compilers and build tools) but the human understandable end of the process is mostly based on text files. In the previous section, we described a <a href="#infra-code-example">simple script</a> that altered the state of a computer system. We care very much about when such a text file changes. One wrong character can completely alter the behavior of a large, complex system. Therefore, our configuration management approach must track to that level of detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source control is at its most powerful when dealing with textual data. It is less useful in dealing with  binary data, such as image files. Text files can analyzed for their differences in an easy to understand way. If I change "abc" to "abcd" it is clear that the third character has been changed from “c” to “d.” On the other hand, if I take a picture (e.g. as a *.png file) and alter one pixel, and compare the resulting before and after binary files in terms of their data, it would be more difficult to understand what had changed. I might be able to easily tell that they are two different files, but they would look very similar and the difference in the binary data might be difficult to understand. Here is a detailed demonstration, using the command line in Ubuntu Linux. (Don&#8217;t worry, we will explain what is going on.)</p>

<h6 id="_the_commit_concept">The "commit" concept</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although implementation details may differ, all version control systems have some concept of “commit.” As stated in <em>Version Control with Git</em> <a href="#Loeliger2009">[Loeliger2009]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>In Git, a commit is used to record changes to a repository… Every Git commit represents a single, <strong>atomic</strong> changeset with respect to the previous state. Regardless of the number of directories, files, lines, or bytes that change with a commit… either all changes apply or none do.</em> [emphasis added]</p>

<td class="content">
*Why "atomic"? The word atomic derives from the ancient Latin language, and means "indivisible." An atomic set of changes is either entirely applied, or entirely rejected. Atomicity is an important concept in computing, and transaction processing in particular. If our user tries to move money from her savings to her checking account, two operations are required: (1) reduce savings and (2) increase checking. Either both need to succeed, or both need to fail. That is the classic definition of an "atomic" transaction. Version control commits should be atomic.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of a version or source control <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(data_management)">“commit”</a> is a rich foundation for IT management and governance. It both represents the state of the computing system as well as providing evidence of the human activity affecting it. As we will see in Chapter 3, the “commit” identifier is directly referenced by build activity, which in turn is referenced by the release activity, which is typically visible across the IT value chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the concept of an atomic “commit” is essential to the concept of a “branch” - the creation of an experimental version, completely separate from the main version, so that various alterations can be tried without compromising the overall system stability. Starting at the point of a “commit,” the branched version also becomes evidence of human activity around a potential future for the system. In some environments, the branch is automatically created with the assignment of a requirement or story - again, more on this to come in chapter 3. In other environments, the very concept of branching is avoided.</p>

<p>In some organizations, it was once common for compiled binaries to be stored in the same repositories as source code. However, this is no longer considered a best practice. Source and package management are now viewed as two separate things.  Source repositories should be reserved for text-based artifacts whose differences can be made visible in a human-understandable way. Package repositories in contrast are for binary artifacts that can be deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Package repositories also can serve as a proxy to the external world of downloadable software. That is, they are a cache, an intermediate store of the software provided by various "upstream" sources. For example, developers may be told to download the approved Ruby on Rails version from the local package repository, rather than going to the getting the latest version, which may not be suitable for the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Package repositories are also used to enable collaboration between teams working on large systems. Teams can check in their built components into the package repository for other teams to download. This is more efficient than everyone  always building all parts of the application from the source repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The boundary between source and package is not hard and fast, however. One does see binary files in source repositories, such as images used in an application. Also, when interpreted languages (such as Javascript) are "packaged," they still appear in the package as text files, perhaps compressed or otherwise incorporated into some larger containing structure.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version control is an important part of the overall concept of configuration management.

<p>Resources in version control in general are not yet active in any value-adding sense. In order for them to deliver experiences, they must be combined with computing resources: servers (physical or virtual), storage, nettworking, and the rest, whether owned by the organization or leased as <a href="#Cloud">Cloud services</a>. The process of doing so is called deployment. Version control manages the state of the artifacts; deployment management (as another configuration management practice) manages the <strong>combination of those artifacts with the needed resources for value delivery</strong>.</p>

<h6 id="_imperative_and_declarative">Imperative and Declarative</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we turned to source control, we looked at a <a href="#infra-code-example">simple script</a> that changed the configuration of a computer. It did so in an <em>imperative</em> fashion. Imperative and declarative are two important terms from computer science.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">A simple example of “declarative” vs “imperative”</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Declarative:</strong> "Our refrigerator should always have a gallon of milk in it.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Imperative:</strong> “Go out the door, take a right, take a left, go into the building with a big ‘SA’ on it, go in to the last aisle, take a left, go to the third case and take the first container on the fourth shelf from the bottom. Give money to the cashier and bring the container back home.”</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an imperative approach, we tell the computer specifically how we want to accomplish a task, e.g.:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Create a directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create some files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create another directory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create more files</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And so on. Many traditional programming languages take an imperative approach. A script such as <a href="#infra-code-example">iac.sh example</a> is executed line by line, i.e., it is imperative. In configuring infrastructure, scripting is in general considered “imperative," but state of the art infrastructure automation frameworks are built using a “declarative,” policy-based approach, in which the object is to define the desired end state of the resource, not the steps needed to get there.  With such an approach, instead of defining a set of steps, we simply define the proper configuration as a target, saying (in essence) that "this computer should always have a directory structure thus; do what you need to do to make it so and keep it this way":</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More practically, declarative approaches are used to ensure that the proper versions of software are always present on a system, and that configurations such as Internet ports and security settings do not vary from the intended specification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a complex topic and there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach. (See "When and Where Order Matters" by Mark Burgess for an advanced discussion <a href="#Burgess2016">[Burgess2016]</a>.) But policy-based approaches seem to have the upper hand for now.</p>

<p>This and following chapters in this book will end with a "topics" section, in which current and specialized developments will be discussed.</p>

<p><a id="commit-as-metadata"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_configuration_management_version_control_and_metadata">Configuration management, version control, and metadata</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Version control, in particular source control, is where we start to see the emergence of an <em>architecture of IT management</em>. It is in the source control system that we first start to see <em>metadata</em> emerge as an independent concern. Metadata is a tricky term, that tends to generate confusion. The term “meta” implies a concept that is somehow self-referential, and/or operating at a higher level of abstraction. So,</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>the term meta-discussion is a discussion about the discussion;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meta-cognition is cognition about cognition, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>meta-data (aka metadata) is data about data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some examples:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In traditional data management, metadata is the description of the data structures, especially from a business point of view. A database column might be named “CUST_L_NM,” but the business description or metadata would be “The last, family, or surname of the customer.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In document management, the document metadata is the record of who created the document and when, when it was last updated, and so forth. Failure to properly sanitize document metadata has led to various privacy and data security related issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In telephony,  “data” is the actual call signal — the audio of the phone conversation, nowadays usually digitally encoded. Metadata on the other hand is all the information about the call: from who to who, when, how long, and so forth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In computer systems, metadata can be difficult to isolate. Sometimes, computing professionals will speak of a “metadata” layer that may define physical database structures, data extracts, business process behavior, even file locations. The trouble is, from a computer’s point of view, a processing instruction is an instruction, and the prefix “meta” has no real meaning.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this, this book favors a principle that <strong>metadata is by definition non-runtime.</strong> It is documentation, usually represented as structured or semi-structured data, but not usually a primary processing input or output. It might be “digital exhaust” - log files are a form of metadata. It is not executable. If it’s  executable (directly or indirectly), it’s digital logic or configuration, plain and simple.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So what about our infrastructure as code example? The artifact - the configuration file, the script - is NOT metadata, because it is executable. But the source repository commit IS metadata. It has no meaning for the script. The dependency is one way - without the artifact, the commit ID is meaningless, but the artifact is completely ignorant of the commit. The commit may become an essential data point for human beings trying to make sense of the state of a resource defined by that artifact. However, the version control system &#8230;&#8203;</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>doesn’t care why files are changing. That is, the content of the changes doesn’t matter. As the developer, you might move a function from here to there and expect this to be handled as one unitary move. But you could, alternatively, commit the removal and then later commit the addition. Git doesn’t care. It has nothing to do with the semantics of what is in the files</em> <a href="#Loeliger2009">[Loeliger2009]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>In this microcosm, we see the origins of IT management.</strong>
It is not always easy to apply this approach in practice. There can be edge cases. Documentation stored in version control needs to be seen as "executable" in the context of the business process. But it too does not require or "know about" the comit. Ultimately <strong>the concept of metadata provides a basis for distinguishing the <em>management</em> of information technology from the actual <em>practice</em> of information technology.</strong></p>

<h4 id="_conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Books and articles are written every week about some aspect of IT infrastructure. We have only scratched the surface in our discussions of compute, network, and storage, and how they have become utility services in the guise of Cloud.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software as a service, platform as a service, infrastructure as a service - each represents a different approach. For the most part, we will focus on Infrastructure as a Service in the remainder of this book, on the assumption that your digital product is unique enough to need the broad freedom this provides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT infrastructure is a rich and complex topic, and a person can spend their career specializing in it. For this class, we always want to keep chapter 1 in mind: why do we want it? How does it provide for our needs, contribute to our enjoyment?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are numerous sources available to you to learn Linux scripting, policy-based configuration management of infrastructure, and source control. Competency with source control is essential to your career and you should devote some serious time to it. You can find many references to source control on the Internet and in books such as <em>Pro Git</em> by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub <a href="#Chacon2009">[Chacon2009]</a>. As it is the most important foundational technology for professional IT, whether in a garage or in the largest corporations, you need to have a deep familiarity with it.</p>

<p>We will discuss further infrastructure issues in Chapter 6, including designing systems for failure and availability.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have opted to defer the "theory" of Agile to Chapters 4 and 5. So, this chapter presents Agile and related concepts like iterative development without examining the underlying principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I do this because I have discovered that theory sometimes works better in retrospect. Many students increasingly come in with some exposure to Cloud and Agile methods at least, and Chapters 2 and 3 will seem comfortable and familiar. In Chapters 4 and on we challenge them with <strong>why</strong> Agile works.</p>

<p>Now that we have some idea of IT value (and how we might turn it into a product), and have decided on some infrastructure, we can start building.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems that directly create value for non-technical users are usually called "applications," or sometimes "services." As discussed in chapter 1, they enable value experiences in areas as diverse as consumer banking, entertainment and hospitality, and personal transportation. In fact it is difficult to think of any aspect of modern life untouched by applications. (This overall trend is sometimes called digital transformation.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications are built from software, the development of which is a core concern for any IT-centric product strategy. Software development is a well established career, and a fast-moving field with new technologies, frameworks, and schools of thought emerging weekly, it seems. This chapter will cover applications and the software lifecycle, from requirements through construction, testing, building, and deployment into modern production environments. It also discusses earlier approaches to software development, the rise of the Agile movement, and its current manifestation in the practice of DevOps.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In keeping with our commitment to theory and first principles, we use an engineering definition of "application." To an electrical engineer, a toaster or a light bulb is an "application" of electricity. Similarly, a customer relationship management system, or a Web video on demand service, are "applications" of the core computer infrastructure we studied in the last chapter.</p>

<p>Without applications, computers would be merely a curiousity. Computers were first "applied" to military needs for codebreaking and artillery calculations. After World War II, ex-military officers like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Berkeley">Edmund Berkeley</a> at Prudential realized their potential if "applied" to problems like insurance record keeping. <a href="#Akera2007">[Akera2007]</a> At first, such systems required actual manual configuration (as in the ENIAC photo in this section), or painstaking programming in complex, tedious, and unforgiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-level_programming_language">low-level programming languages</a>. As the value of computers became obvious, investment was made in making programming easier through more powerful languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_software">history of software</a> is well documented. Low level languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">binary</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembler</a>) were increasingly replaced by higher level languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">FORTAN</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">C</a>). Proprietary machine/language combinations were replaced by open standards and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compilers</a> that could take one kind of source code and build it for different hardware platforms. Many languages followed, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic">Visual Basic</a>, and <a href="https://www.javascript.com/">Javascript</a>.

<h5 id="_applications_and_infrastructure_the_old_way">Applications and infrastructure: the old way</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the first decades of computing, any significant application of computing power to a new problem typically required its own <a href="#what-is-IT-infrastructure">infrastructure</a>, often designed specifically for the problem. While awareness existed that computers in theory could be "general purpose," in practice this was not so easy. Military/aerospace needs differed from corporate information systems, which differed from scientific and technical uses. And major new applications required new compute capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Take for example when a corporation in 1998 decided to replace its mainframe Human Resources system due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K concerns</a>. Such a system might need to support several thousand users around the world. At that time, PeopleSoft was a frequent choice of software. Implementing such a system was often led by consulting firms such as Deloitte or Andersen Consulting (where the author worked). A typical PeopleSoft package implementation would include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PeopleSoft">PeopleSoft</a> software, including the PeopleTools framework and various modules written in the framework (e.g. the well-regarded PeopleSoft HR system)</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-UX">HP-UX operating system</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>HP-UX servers, perhaps 20 or so, comprising various "environments" including a production "cluster" consisting of application and database servers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMC_Corporation">EMC</a> storage array</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Various ancillary software and hardware: management utilities and scripts, backup, networking, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Customization of the PeopleSoft HR module and reports by hired consultants, to meet the requirements of the acquiring organization</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The software and hardware needed to be specified in keeping with requirements, and acquiring it took lengthy negotiations and logistics and installation processes. Such a project from inception to production might take 9 months (on the short side) to 18 or more months.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hardware was dedicated and rarely re-used. The HP servers compatible with PeopleSoft might have few other applications, if they became surplus. In fact, PeopleSoft would "certify" the infrastructure for compatibility. Upgrading the software might require also upgrading the hardware. In essence, this sort of effort had a strong component of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering">systems engineering</a>, as designing and optimizing the hardware component was a significant portion of the work.</p>

<p>Today, matters are quite different, and yet echoes of the older model persist. As mentioned, ANY  compute workloads are going to incur economic cost. However, capacity is being used more efficiently and can be provisioned on demand. Currently, it is a significant application indeed that merits its own systems engineering.</p>

<p>Instead, a variety of mechanisms (as covered in the previous chapter&#8217;s <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_from_physical_compute_to_cloud">discussion of Cloud systems</a>) enable the sharing of compute capacity, the raw material of application development. The fungibility and agility of these mechanisms increase the velocity of creation and evolution of application software. For small and medium sized applications, the overwhelming trend is to <a href="#virtualization">virtualize</a>
 and run on  commodity hardware and operating systems. Even 15 years ago, non-trivial web sites with database integration would be hosted by internal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service">PaaS</a> clusters at major enterprises (for example, Microsoft ASP, COM+, and SQL Server clusters could be managed as multi-tenant&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the author wrote systems on such a platform).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general purpose capabilities of virtualized public and private Cloud today are robust. Assuming the organization has the financial capability to purchase computing capacity in anticipation of use, it can be instantly available when the need surfaces. Hardware engineering is more and more independent of the application lifecycle; the trend is towards providing compute as a service, carefully specified in terms of performance, but NOT particular hardware. Hardware physically dedicated to a single application is rarer, and even the largest engineered systems are more standardized so that they may one day benefit from Cloud approaches.  Application architectures have also become much more powerful. Interfaces (interaction points for applications to exchange information with each other, generally in an automated way) are increasingly standardized. Applications are designed to scale dynamically with workload and are more stable and reliable than in years past.</p>

<h4 id="_from_waterfall_to_agile">From waterfall to Agile</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a book on software development per se, nor on Agile development. There are hundreds of books available on those topics. But, no assumption is made that the reader has any familiarity with these topics, so some basic history is called for. (If you have taken an introductory course in software engineering, this will likely be review.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the author first joined Andersen Consulting (now Accenture) in 1998, we were schooled in something called the Business Integration Method, or BIM. The BIM was a classic expression of what is called “waterfall development".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is waterfall development? It is a controversial question. The original theorist who coined the term named it in order to critique it <a href="#Royce1970">[Royce1970]</a>. Military contracting and management consultancy practices, however, embraced it, as it provided an illusion of certainty. The fact that computer systems until recently included a substantial component of hardware systems engineering may also have contributed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Waterfall development as a term has become associated with a number of practices. The original illustration was similar to this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.03-waterfall.png" alt="waterfall progression" width="500">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 29. Waterfall lifecycle</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, requirements need to be extensively captured and analyzed before the work of development should commence. So, the project team would develop enormous spreadsheets of requirements, spending weeks on making sure that they represented what “the customer” wanted. The objective was to get the customer’s signature. Any further alterations could be profitably billed as “change requests."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The analysis phase was used to develop a more structured understanding of the requirements, e.g. conceptual and logical data models, process models, business rules, and so forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the design phase, the actual technical platforms would be chosen; major subsystems determined with their connection points, initial capacity analysis (<em>volumetrics</em>) translated into system sizing, and so forth. (Perhaps hardware would not be ordered until this point, leading to issues with developers now being “ready”, but hardware not being available for weeks or months yet).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only AFTER extensive requirements, analysis, and design would coding take place (implementation). Furthermore, there were separation of duties between developers and testers. Developers would write code and testers would try to break it, filing bug reports that the developers would then need to respond to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another model sometimes encountered at this time was the V-model. This was intended to better represent the various levels of abstraction operating in the systems delivery activity. Requirements operate at various levels, from high level business intent through detailed specifications. It is all too possible that a system is “successfully” implemented at lower levels of specification, but fails to satisfy the original higher level intent.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.03-vmodel.png" alt="1.03 vmodel">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 30. V-model <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_14" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_14" title="View footnote.">14</a>]</sup></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The failures of these approaches at scale are by now well known. Large distributed teams would wrestle with thousands of requirements. The customer would “sign off” on multiple large binders, with widely varying degrees of understanding of what they were agreeing to. Documentation became an end in itself, and yet did not meet its objectives of ensuring continuity if staff turned over. The development team would design and build extensive product implementations without checking the results with customers. They would also defer testing that various component parts would effectively interoperate until the very end of the project, when the time came to assemble the whole system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Failure after failure of this approach is apparent in the historical record (<a href="#Glass1998">[Glass1998]</a>). Recognition of such failures, dating from the 1960s, led to the perception of a “software crisis.”  (It should also be noted that many large systems were effectively constructed and operated during the "waterfall years", and that there are reasonable criticisms of the concept of a “software crisis” <a href="#Bossavit2015">[Bossavit2015]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful development efforts existed back to the earliest days of computing (otherwise, we probably wouldn’t have computers, or at least not so many). Many of these successful efforts used prototypes and other means of building understanding and proving out approaches. But highly publicized failures continued, and a substantial movement against “waterfall” development started to take shape.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the 1990s, a number of thought leaders in software development had noticed some common themes with what seemed to work and what didn’t. Kent Beck developed a methodology known as “eXtreme Programming,” or XP <a href="#Beck2000">[Beck2000]</a>. XP pioneered the concepts of iterative, fast-cycle development with ongoing stakeholder feedback, coupled with test-driven development, ongoing refactoring, pair programming, and other practices. (More on the specifics of these in the next section.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Various authors assembled in 2001 and developed the Agile Manifesto <a href="#Alliance2001">[Alliance2001]</a>, which further emphasized an emergent set of values and practices:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Agile models for developing software aligned with the rise of Cloud and Web-scale IT. As new customer-facing sites like Flickr, Amazon, Netflix, Etsy, and Facebook scaled to massive proportions, it become increasingly clear that waterfall approaches were incompatible with their needs. Because these systems were directly user-facing, delivering monetized value in fast-moving competitive marketplaces, they required a degree of responsiveness previously not seen in “back-office” IT or military-aerospace domains (the major forms that large scale system development had taken to date). We will talk more of product-centricity and the overall DevOps movement in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This new world did not think in terms of large requirements specifications. Capturing a requirement, analyzing and designing to it, implementing it, testing that implementation, and deploying the result to the end user for feedback became something that needed to happen at speed, with high repeatability. Requirements "backlogs" were (and are) never "done," and increasingly were the subject of ongoing re-prioritization, without high-overhead project "change" barriers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web-based systems integrate the software development lifecycle tightly with operational concerns. The development of new functionality is moved rapidly into a user-facing state, as opposed to previous models where software development was more distant in time and personnel from operations staff. The sheer size and complexity of these systems required much more incremental and iterative approaches to delivery, as the system could never be taken offline for the "next major release" to be installed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software was moving more directly into an operational state, and developers and operators were part of the same economic concern (contract software development never gained favor in the Silicon Valley web-scale community). So, it was possible to start breaking down the walls between “development” and “operations,” and that is just what happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because large scale systems are complex and unpredictable, it is understood that new features are never fully understood until they are deployed at scale to the real end user base. Therefore, large scale web properties also started to “test in production” (more on this in Chapter 6) in the sense that they would deploy new functionality to only some of their users. Rather than trying to increase testing to better understand things before deployment, these new firms accepted a seemingly higher level of risk in exposing new functionality sooner. (Part of their belief is that it actually is lower risk, because the impacts are never fully understood in any event.)</p>

<h4 id="_the_devops_challenge">The DevOps challenge</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider this inquiry by Mary and Tom Poppendieck (<a href="#Poppendieck2007">[Poppendieck2007]</a>, p. 92):</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>How long would it take your organization to deploy a change that involved one single line of code? Do you deploy changes at this pace on a repeat, reliable basis?</strong></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implicit goal is that the organization should be able to change one line of code, and in fact might want to do so on an ongoing basis. There is deep Lean/Agile theory behind this goal, theory developed in reaction to the pattern of massive software failures that characterized IT in the first fifty years of its existence. (We&#8217;ll discuss some of the systems theory, including the concept of feedback, in the introduction to Part II and other aspects of Agile theory, including the ideas of Lean Product Development, in Parts II and III.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Achieving this goal is feasible but requires new approaches. Various practitioners have explored this problem, with great success. Key initial milestones included:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<p>The establishment of “test-driven development” as a key best practice in creating software <a href="#Beck2000">[Beck2000]</a></p>

<p>While "DevOps" can be hard to define, the fundamental goal of moving smaller changes more quickly through the pipeline is a common theme. Other guiding principles include, "If it hurts, do it more frequently." (This is in part a response to the poor practice, or <em>antipattern</em>, of deferring integration testing and deployment until those tasks are so big as to be unmanageable.) There is a great deal written on the topic of DevOps currently; the Humble/Farley book is recommended  as an introduction. Let’s go into a little detail on some essential Agile/DevOps practices.</p>

<p>The assumption in this chapter is that you are going to start IMMEDIATELY with a continuous delivery pipeline. <strong>You want to set this up before developing a single line of code.</strong> This is not something to "get around to later." It’s not that difficult (see the online resources for further discussion and pointers to relevant open source projects). What is meant by a continuous delivery pipeline? Here is a simplified, starting overview, based on the <a href="https://github.com/dm-academy/Calavera">Calavera project</a> developed for the IT Delivery course at the University of St. Thomas:</p>

<p>First, some potential for value is identified. It is refined through product management techniques into a feature - some specific set of functionality that when complete will enable the value proposition (i.e. as a <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_it_services_systems_and_applications">moment of truth</a>.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The feature is expressed as some set of IT work, today usually in small increments lasting between 1 and 4 weeks (this of course varies). Software development commences, e.g. the creation of Java components by developers who first write tests, and then write code that satisfies the test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer is continually testing the software as the build progresses, and keeping a local source control repository up to date with their changes at all times. When she or he reaches a level of satisfaction with the software, it is submitted to a centralized source repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the repository detects the new "check-in," it contacts the build choreography manager, which launches a dedicated environment to build and test the new code. The environment is likely configured using <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_infrastructure_as_code">infrastructure as code</a> techniques; in this way, it can be created automatically and quickly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the code passes all tests, the compiled and built binary executables may then be "checked in" to a package management repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the package repository, the code may then be deployed to various environments, for further testing and ultimately to "production," where it can enable the consumer&#8217;s value experiences.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, you’ve got an idea for a product value experience, and you have tools for creating it and infrastructure for running it. It’s time to start building shippable product. As we will cover in more detail in the next chapter, the product development process starts with a concept of requirements (whether we call it story, use case, or scenario is not important). Requirements are numerous and evolving, and we’re going to take some time looking at the process of converting them into IT-based functionality. There is history here back to the earliest days of computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to design and build a digital product, you need to express what you need the product to do. The conceptual tool used to do this is called Requirement.
The literal word “Requirement” has fallen out of favor with the rise of Agile <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a>, and has a number of synonyms and variations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use case</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User story</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nonfunctional requirement</p>

<li>
<p>Epic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectural epic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Architectural requirement</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While these may differ in terms of focus and scope, the basic concept is the same - the requirement, however named, expresses some intent or constraint the system must fulfill. This intent calls for work to be performed.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Sidebar: The troubled term "requirements"</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In earlier times, the concept of "requirements" was often used as an sort of defense mechanism. Statements would often be heard such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We can&#8217;t start building anything, we don&#8217;t fully understand the requirements"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We can&#8217;t change the requirements now, we&#8217;ve started building! Make up your mind!"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"The product is a failure because the business kept changing their mind about the requirements."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the term "requirements" is still used throughout much education and training, the student should be aware of this history, and the fact that many Agile practitioners discourage use of the term.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Jeff Patton says, "&#8230;&#8203;I learned the word requirements actually means <em>shut up</em>." <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a>, introduction.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>User Story Mapping is a well known approach <a href="#Patton2014">[Patton2014]</a> with origins in the Scrum community. Here is an example from <a href="#Cohn2010">[Cohn2010]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"As a shopper, I can select how I want items shipped based on the actual costs of shipping to my address so that I can make the best decision."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic format is,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a &lt; type of user &gt;, I want &lt; goal &gt;, so that &lt; some value &gt;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The story concept is flexible, and can be aggregated and decomposed in various ways, as we will discuss in Chapter 4. Our interest here is in the basic stimulus for application development work that it represents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You don&#8217;t need an extensively automated system at this stage to capture requirements, but you need <strong>something</strong>. It could be a spreadsheet, or a shared word processing document, or sticky notes on a whiteboard (we&#8217;ll talk about Kanban in the next section.) The important thing is to start somewhere, with team agreement as to what the approach is, so you can move forward collaboratively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss approaches for "discovering" user stories and product features in Chapter 4, where Product Management is formalized. For now, as an early startup of one or two people, it is sufficient that you have some basic ability to characterize your system intent&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;more formalized techniques come later.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Testing software and systems is a critically important part of digital product development. The earliest concepts of <a href="#1.03.02-Agile-history">waterfall development</a> called for it explicitly, and "software tester" as a role and "software quality assurance" as a practice have long histories. Evolutionary approaches to software have a potential major issue with software testing:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
As a consequence of the introduction of new bugs, program maintenance requires far more system testing per statement written than any other programming. Theoretically, after each fix one must run the entire bank of test cases previously run against the system, to ensure that it has not been damaged in an obscure way.
In practice such regression testing must indeed approximate this theoretical ideal, and it is very costly.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This issue was and is well known to thought leaders in Agile software development. The key response has been the concept of automated testing, so that any change in the software can be immediately validated before more development along those lines continues. One pioneering tool was JUnit:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<em>The reason JUnit is important . . . is that the presence of this tiny tool has been essential to a fundamental shift for many programmers.

<p>In test-driven development, the idea essence is to write code that tests itself, and in fact to <strong>write the test before writing any code</strong>. This is done through the creation of test harnesses and the tight association of tests with requirements.

<blockquote>
Refactoring is a controlled technique for improving the design of an existing code base. Its essence is applying a series of small behavior-preserving transformations, each of which is "too small to be worth doing". However, the cumulative effect of each of these transformations is quite significant. By doing them in small steps you reduce the risk of introducing errors. You also avoid having the system broken while you are carrying out the restructuring - which allows you to gradually refactor a system over an extended period of time.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As systems engineering approaches transform to <a href="#cloud">Cloud</a> and <a href="#infracode">Infrastructure as Code</a>, a large and increasing percentage of IT work takes the form of altering text files and tracking their <a href="#version-control">versions</a>. We have seen this in the previous chapter, with artifacts such as <a href="#infra-code-example">scripts</a> being created to drive the provisioning and configuring of computing resources. Approaches which encourage ongoing development and evolution are increasingly recognized as less risky, since systems do not respond well to big "batches" of change. An important concept is that of "continuous integration,” popularized by Paul Duvall in his book of the same name <a href="#Duvall2007">[Duvall2007]</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to understand why continuous integration is important, it is necessary to further discuss the concept of source control and how it is employed in real world settings. Imagine Mary have been working for some time with her partner Aparna in their startup (or on a small team) and they have three code modules. Mary is writing the web front end (file A), Aparna is writing the administrative tools and reporting (file C), and they both partner on the data access layer (file B). The conflict of course arises on the file B that they both need to work on.  A and C are mostly independent of each other, but changes to any part of B can have an impact on both their modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If changes are frequently needed to B, and yet they cannot split it into logically separate modules, they have a problem; they cannot both work on the same file at the same time. They are each concerned that the other does not introduce changes into B that “break” the code in their own modules A and C.</p>

Breaking a system apart by "layer" (e.g. front end versus data access) does not scale well. Microservices approaches encourage keeping data access and business logic together in functionally cohesive units. More on this in future chapters. But in this example, both developers are on the same small team. It is not always possible (or worth it) to divide work to keep two people from ever needing to change the same thing.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In smaller environments, or under older practices, perhaps there is no conflict, or perhaps they can agree to take turns. But even if they are taking turns, Mary still needs to test her code in A to make sure it’s not been broken by changes Aparna made in B. And what if they really both need to work on B at the same time?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, because they took this book&#8217;s advice and didn&#8217;t start developing until they had <a href="#version-control">version control</a> in place, each of them works on a "local" copy of the file (see illustration "File B being worked on by 2 people").</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That way, they can move ahead on their local workstations. But when the time comes to combine both of your work, they may find themselves in "merge hell." They may have chosen very different approaches to solving the same problem, and code may need massive revision to settle on one code base. For example, in the accompanying illustration, Mary&#8217;s changes to B are represented by triangles and Aparna&#8217;s are represented by circles. They each had a local version on their workstation for far too long, without talking to each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the diagrams, we represent the changes graphically; of course, with real code, the different graphics represent different development approaches each person took. For example, Mary had certain needs for how errors were handled, while Aparna had different needs.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the diagram "Merge hell," where triangles and circles overlap, Mary and Aparna painstakingly have to go through and put in a consolidated error handling approach, so that the code supports both of their needs. The problem of course is now there are three ways errors are being handled in the code. This is not good, but they did not have time to go back and fix all the cases. This is a classic example of <a href="#technical-debt-1">technical debt</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose instead that they had been checking in every day. They can identify the first collision quickly, and have a conversation about what the best error handling approach is. This saves them <strong>both</strong> the rework of fixing the collisions, <strong>and</strong> the technical debt they might have otherwise accepted:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>These problems have driven the evolution of software configuration management for decades. In previous methods, to develop a new release, the code would be copied into a very long-lived "branch" (a version of the code to receive independent enhancement). Ongoing “maintenance” fixes of the existing code base would also continue, and the two code bases would inevitably diverge. Switching over to the “new” code base might mean that once-fixed bugs (bugs that had been addressed by maintenance activities) would show up again, and of course this would not be acceptable. So, when the newer development was complete, it would need to be merged back into the older line of code, and this was rarely if ever easy (again, "merge hell"). In a worst case scenario, the new development might have to be redone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter continuous integration. As presented in <a href="#Duvall2007">[Duvall2007]</a> the key practices (you will notice similarities to the <a href="#pipeline">pipeline discussion</a>) include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Developers run private builds including their automated tests before committing to source control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developers check in to source control at least daily (hopefully we have been harping on this enough that you are taking it seriously by now).</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Distributed version control systems such as git are especially popular, although older centralized products are <a href="http://bitquabit.com/post/unorthodocs-abandon-your-dvcs-and-return-to-sanity/">starting to adopt some of their functionality</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration builds happen several times a day or more on a separate, dedicated machine</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>100% of tests must pass for each build. Fixing failed builds is the highest priority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A package or similar executable artifact is produced for functional testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A defined package repository exists as a definitive location for the build output.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These practices are well developed and represent a highly evolved understanding gained through the painful trial and error of many development teams over many years. Rather than locking C so that only one person can work on it at a time, it’s been found that the best approach is to allow developers to actually make multiple copies of such a file or file set and work on them simultaneously. Wait, you say. How can that work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the principle of continuous integration at work. If the developers are continually pulling each other’s work into their own working copies, and continually testing that nothing has broken, then distributed development can take place. So, if you are a developer, the day’s work might be as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8 AM: check out files from master source repository to a local branch on your workstation. Because files are not committed unless they pass all tests, you know that you are checking out clean code. You pull user story (requirement) that you will now develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>8:30 AM: You define a test and start developing the code to fulfill it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>10 AM: You are closing in on wrapping up the first requirement. You check the source repository. Your partner has checked in some new code, so you pull it down to your local repository. You run all the automated tests and nothing breaks, so you’re fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>10:30: You complete your first update of the day; it passes all tests on your workstation. You commit it to the master repository. The master repository is continually monitored by the build server, which takes the code you created and deploys it, along with all necessary configurations, to a dedicated build server (which might be just a virtual machine or transient container). All tests pass there (the test you defined as indicating success for the module, as well as a host of older tests that are routinely run whenever the code is updated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>11:00: Your partner pulls your changes into their working directory. Unfortunately, some changes you made conflict with some work they are doing. You briefly consult and figure out a mutually acceptable approach.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Controlling simultaneous changes to a common file is only one benefit of continuous integration. When software is developed by teams, even if each team has its own artifacts, the system often fails to "come together" for higher-order testing to confirm that all the parts are working correctly together. Discrepancies are often found in the interfaces between components; when component A calls component B, it may receive output it did not expect and processing halts. Continuous integration ensures that such issues are caught early.</p>

</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once software is compiled and built, the executable files that can be installed and run operationally should be checked into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Package_manager">Package Manager</a>. At that point, one can take the last mile step and deploy the now tested and built software to pre-production or production environments. The software can undergo user testing, load testing, integration testing, and so forth. Once those tests are passed, it can be deployed to production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(What is “production,” anyway? We’ll talk about environments in Section 2. For now, you just need to know that when an IT-based product is “in production,” that means it is live and available to its intended base of end users or customers.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Moving new code into production has always been a risky procedure. Changing a running system always entails some uncertainty. However, the practice of infrastructure as code coupled with increased virtualization has reduced the risk. Often, a rolling release strategy is employed so that code is deployed to small sets of servers while other servers continue to service the load. This requires careful design to allow the new and old code to co-exist at least for a brief time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is important so that the versions of software used in production are well controlled and consistent. The package manager can then be associated with some kind of deploy tool that keeps track of what versions are associated with which infrastructure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Timing varies by organization. Some strive for true "continuous deployment," in which the new code flows seamlessly from developer commit through build, test, package and deploy. Others put gates in between the developer and check-in to mainline, or source to build, or package to deploy, so that some human governance remains in the toolchain. We will go into more detail on these topics in chapter 6.</p>

<p>The design and architecture of applications is a large topic (see e.g. <a href="#Gamma1995">[Gamma1995]</a> and <a href="#Fowler2003">[Fowler2003]</a>) and this text only touches lightly on it. <a href="http://www.iso-architecture.org/ieee-1471/defining-architecture.html">ISO/IEC 41010</a> defines architecture as “the fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and evolution.”</p>

<p>A computer program can be as simple as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">Hello World.</a> Such a program requires only one or a few files to compile and execute. However, significant applications such as an online video streaming service require hardware and software configurations of <a href="http://techblog.netflix.com/search/label/cloud%20architecture">tremendous complexity</a>.  Specialized visual notations are used to describe this complexity, as in the image above. We will discuss this further in Chapter 12.</p>

<p>Because the initial applications were implemented as a kind of systems engineering, and were expensive to build and maintain, the technique of choice was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management">project management</a>. Project management will not be covered in this book until Part III, as it is not appropriate to the earlier stages of this book&#8217;s <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_a_process_of_emergence">emergence model</a>.</p>

<p>This history of project managed systems engineering produced any number of successes, but by the early 1990s there were significant concerns with the rate of large project failures <a href="#Glass1998">[Glass1998]</a>, which occurred despite seemingly extensive and rigorous bureaucratic overhead, evidenced by frameworks such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model_Integration">CMMI</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Management_Body_of_Knowledge">PMBOK</a>. <sup class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_16" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_16" title="View footnote.">16</a>]</sup></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications are why computers exist. Supporting applications increasingly is less about systems engineering, and more about quickly provisioning standard, shared infrastructure. Application development has moved decisively in the past twenty years to Agile delivery models, based on techniques such as:</p>

<h3 id="_part_i_conclusion">Part I Conclusion</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are now at the end of the first section, and one quarter the way through this book (and this course, assuming you are taking a semester long treatment).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are now the proud master or mistress of a functioning startup. You have decided to provide some product that at least partially depends on an IT-based component that you need to actively develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You understand the value that IT brings, and your own product’s needs for it. You have chosen at least a functioning platform for initial development, without falling into the trap of analysis paralysis, although at this point you should be keeping your options open if your initial platform choice doesn’t prove out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you have implemented at least a lightweight continuous delivery pipeline. You didn’t need to spend any money doing this, as so much powerful technology is freely available. In particular, from the start you have taken version control very seriously and have a stable, backed up source repository as a basis for your product development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also have at least rudimentary systems for tracking requirements, building your software, storing your packages, and deploying them to your production environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Congratulations, you’ve got all the basics in place. Your product is starting to attract sales and/or investors, and you’ve hired a few more people. Let’s talk about collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Staying at Level 1</strong>
In your career, many - perhaps even the majority - of the people you meet and work with will be focused on Level 1 in their thinking and approach. This is a fine thing and to be expected. Level 1 is where the real work is done.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_part_ii_introduction">Part II introduction</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scenario</strong>
You are part of a tight-knit team. You’ve moved out of the garage into a more professionalized environment. You might not all be in the same room, but you have a single mission and a cohesive culture, and you don’t need a lot of overhead to get the job done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your startup has met with some success and you are now a team - still small enough to be fed by two pizzas&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;if people aren&#8217;t that hungry. Even with a few new people comes the need to more clearly establish your product direction, so people are building the right thing. You&#8217;re all in the same location, and can still communicate informally, but there is enough going on that you need a more organized approach to getting work done. Finally, this great thing you&#8217;re building doesn&#8217;t mean much if people cannot understand how best to use it, or if it&#8217;s not running and right people can&#8217;t get to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, things are getting larger and more complex. You have a significant user base, and your founder is increasingly out meeting with users, customers and investors; she isn’t in the room with the product team as much any more… in fact, she just named someone to be “product owner” and what is that all about?</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/svcLifecycle.png" alt="svcLifecycle">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember in Chapter 1 we talked of the user&#8217;s <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/images/1.01-ITStack2.png">value experience</a>, and also how services <a href="http://dm-academy.github.io/aitm/#_the_it_service_lifecycle">evolve over time in a lifecycle</a>?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two primary value experiences:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The value the user derives from the service (e.g. account lookups, or a flawless navigational experience)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value the investor derives from monetizing the product, or comparable incentives (e.g. nonprofit missions)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, the product team derives career value. This becomes more of a factor later in the game. We will discuss this further in chapter 7 on organization, and Part IV on architecture lifecycles &amp; technical debt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The product team receives feedback from both value experiences. The day to day interactions with the service (e.g. help desk and operations) are understood, and (typically on a more intermittent basis) the portfolio investor also feeds back the information to the product team (the boss&#8217;s boss comes for a visit).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is of course a simplified model, and in a large enterprise both the users and investors may have proxies (more on this to come).</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The figure above is an architectural representation of the toolchain we started to develop in Section 1. The toolchain can be seen as part of a value chain that is delivering an IT service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we will look at:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>How you are accepting and executing on feedback signals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the feedback relationship with your investors is evolving, in terms of your product direction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How the feedback relationship with your users is evolving, in terms of both operational criteria and product direction</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss work management, product management, shared mental models, visualization, and systems monitoring.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The practices and approaches established at the team level are critical to the higher levels of scale discussed in Sections 3 and 4. In this section, we discuss small, cross-functional, outcome-oriented teams. We discuss collaboration and customer intimacy, and the need to limit work in process. And we discuss blameless cultures where people are safe to fail and learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If these learnings are not firmly established, the organization may struggle to scale; the need for cross-team coordination can (ironically) destroy the performance of individual teams, if not handled well. Scaling success starts with building a strong team level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Product Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You (as the startup leader) are spending more time with investors and customers, and maintaining alignment around your original product vision is becoming more challenging as you are pulled in various directions. You need some means of keeping the momentum here. And the concept of "product management," you&#8217;re finding, represents a rich set of ideas for managing your team&#8217;s efforts at this stage of the game.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 5: Work Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even with a small team of 5 people (let alone 8 or 9), it&#8217;s too easy for balls to get dropped as work moves between key contributors. You probably don&#8217;t need a complex software-based process management tool yet, but you do need some way of managing work in process. And you start to understand that work takes many forms and exists as a concept at different scales.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 6: Operations Management</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Chapter 3, your application developers have been running your systems and even answering the occasional phone call from customers. You&#8217;re big enough that you need a bit more specialization. You&#8217;ve got dedicated support staff answering the phone calls and you are finding that, even if you rotate operational responsibilities across developers, it is still a distinct kind of "interrupt-driven" work that is not compatible with heads-down, focused software development. You&#8217;ve probably seen by now that complex systems are fragile and tend to fail; how you learn (or don&#8217;t) from those failures is a critical question.</p>

<p>While the term "information systems (IS)" was widely replaced by "information technology (IT)" in the 1990s, do not be fooled. Enterprise IT is a complex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sociotechnical_system">sociotechnical system</a>, that delivers the digital services to support a myriad of other complex sociotechnical systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merriam-Webster <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/system">defines a system</a> as "a regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole". These interactions and relationships quickly take center stage as you move from individual work to team efforts. Consider that while a 2 member team only has 1 relationship to worry about, a 10 member team has 45, and a 100 person team has 4,950!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the Senge quote implies, brute force does not scale well within the context of a system. Systems tend to make their own rules. Within the bounds of the system, actions lead to outcomes, which in turn affect future actions. This <strong>feedback</strong> often becomes amplified and re-amplified through the systems' interactions with itself, until an overload occurs, such as the horrible screeching of a microphone too close to a speaker. In the business world, these feedback loops can manifest themselves in rigid platforms, brittle applications, or even a toxic work culture that sabotages success.</p>

<p>A thorough discussion of systems theory is beyond the scope of this book. However, many of the ideas that follow are informed by it. Obtaining a working knowledge of systems theory will not only enhance your understanding of this book, it can also be an essential tool for managing uncertainty in your future career, teams, and organizations.

<h5 id="_defining_feedback_with_examples">Defining feedback, with examples</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Feedback is a loaded term. We hear terms like positive feedback and negative feedback, and associate it quickly with performance coaching and management discipline. That is not the sense of feedback in this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition of feedback as used in this book is based on engineering. There is considerable related theory in general engineering and especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a> and the reader is encouraged to investigate some of these foundations if unfamiliar.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is the classic illustration of a feedback loop:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/feedback.png" alt="feedback">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we can consider “rabbit reproduction” as a process with a positive feedback loop:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rabbits.png" alt="rabbits">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The more rabbits, the faster they reproduce, and the more rabbits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a “positive” feedback loop, although Mr. MacGregor the local gardener may not agree, given that they are eating all his cabbages!! This is why feedback experts (e.g. <a href="#Sterman2000">[Sterman2000]</a>) prefer to call this “reinforcing” feedback, because there is not necessarily anything “positive” about it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can also consider feedback as the relationship between TWO processes:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/processAB.png" alt="processAB">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our rabbit example, what if Process B is fox reproduction, that is, the birth rate of foxes (who eat rabbits)?</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rabbitfox.png" alt="rabbitfox">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More rabbits equals more foxes (notice the “+” symbol on the line), because there are more rabbits to eat! But what does this do to the rabbits? It means LESS rabbits. Which, ultimately, means less foxes… and at some point, the populations balance. This is classic negative feedback. However, the local foxes don’t see it as negative (nor do the local gardeners!)  That is why feedback experts prefer to call this “balancing” feedback.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In an engineering sense, positive feedback is often dangerous and a topic of concern. The classic example of bad positive feedback in engineering is the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows bridge, "Galloping Gertie."</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with bridges, at a technical level, reinforcing feedback can be a very bad thing in IT systems. In general, any process that is self-amplified without any balancing feedback will eventually consume all available resources, just like rabbits will eat all the food available to them. So, if you create a process (e.g. write and run a computer program) that recursively spawns itself, it will sooner or later crash the computer as it devours memory and CPU. See <a href="http://osr507doc.sco.com/en/HANDBOOK/runaway_proc.html">Runaway processes.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Balancing feedback, on the other hand, is critical to make sure you are “staying on track.” Engineers use concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory">control theory</a>, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damping">damping</a>, to keep bridges from falling down. Balancing feedback in a business and IT context takes a wide variety of forms:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The product owner clarifying for developers the precise user experience vision for the product, based on a demonstration of developer work in process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The end users calling to tell you the “system is slow” (or down)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The product owner or portfolio sponsor calling to tell you they are not satisfied with the system’s value</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, we see these two basic kinds of feedback:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Positive/Reinforcing, “do more of that”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negative/Balancing, “stop doing that,” “fix that”</p>

<p>Because the US fighters were lighter, more maneuverable, and had better visibility, their pilots were able to execute the OODA loop more quickly than their opponents, leading to victory. Boyd and others have extended this concept into various other domains including business strategy. The concept of the OODA feedback loop is frequently mentioned in presentations on Agile methods.</p>

<p>In navigation terminology, the open-loop attempt to stick to a course without external information (e.g. navigating in the fog, without radar or communications) is known as " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_reckoning">dead reckoning</a>," in part because it can easily get you dead!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A good example of an open loop system is the children’s game “pin the tail on the donkey.” In “pin the tail on the donkey,” a person has to execute a process (pinning a paper or cloth "tail" onto a poster of a donkey - no live donkeys are involved!) while blindfolded, based on their memory of their location (and perhaps after being deliberately disoriented by spinning in circles).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since they are blindfolded, they have to move across the room and pin the tail without the ongoing corrective feedback of their eyes. (Perhaps they are getting feedback from their friends, but perhaps their friends are not reliable….)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without the blindfold, it would be a closed loop system. The person would rise from their chair and, through the ongoing feedback of their eyes to their central nervous system, would move towards the donkey and pin the tail in the correct location.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may seem obvious, but the history of IT management (some would say all management) over the past decades has been the struggle to overcome open-loop practices. Reliance on open-loop practices is arguably an indication of a dysfunctional command and control culture. A IT team that is designing and delivering without sufficient corrective feedback from its stakeholders is an ineffective, open-loop system. <a href="#Kennaley2010">[Kennaley2010]</a> applies these principles to software development in much greater depth, and is recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Product Management?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Product management?" In a book on IT management? Those of you with industry experience, especially backgrounds in project-based enterprise software development, may be unfamiliar with the term. However, a focus on product development is one of the distinguishing features of Agile development, even if that development is taking place in a larger enterprise context.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you grow your company, you are bringing more people in. You become concerned that they need to share the same vision that inspired you to create this company. This is the goal of product management as a formalized practice.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product strategy was largely tacit in Part I. As the founder, you used product management and discovery practices, and may well be familiar with the ideas here, but the assumption is that you did not explicitly <strong>formalize</strong> your approach to them. Now you need a more prescriptive and consistent approach to discovering, defining, designing, communicating, and executing a product vision across a diverse team.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we will define and discuss product management, and distinguish it from project and process management. We will cover how product teams are formed and what practices and attitudes you should establish quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will discuss a number of specific schools of thought and practices, including Gothelf&#8217;s Lean UX, Scrum, and more specific techniques for product "discovery." Finally, we will discuss the concepts of design and design thinking.</p>

<p>Before work, before operations, there must be a vision of product. You already established a preliminary vision in Chapter 1, but now as your organization grows, you need to consider further how you will sustain that vision and establish an ongoing capability for realizing it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many other topics in this book, product management is a significant field in and of itself. Historically, product management has <strong>not</strong> been a major theme in enterprise IT management. Digital changes this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems started by serving narrow purposes, often “back office” functions such as accounting or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_requirements_planning">materials planning</a>. Mostly, such systems were managed as projects assembled on a temporary basis, resulting in the creation of a system to be “thrown over the wall” to operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management, on the other hand, is concerned with the entire lifecycle. The product manager cares about the vision, its execution, the market reaction to the vision (even if an internal market), the health, care and feeding of the product, and the product’s eventual sunset or replacement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the enterprise IT world, "third party" vendors (e.g. IBM) providing the back office systems had product management approaches, but these were <strong>external</strong> to the IT operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nor were IT-based product companies as numerous forty years ago as they are today; as noted in chapter 1, the digital component of modern products <a href="#digital-transformation">continues to increase</a> to the point where it&#8217;s often not clear whether a product is "IT" or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reacting to market feedback and adapting product direction is an essential role of the product owner. In the older model, feedback was often unwelcome, as the project manager typically was committed to the <a href="#2.00.1-open-loop">open-loop dead reckoning</a> of the project plan and changing scope or direction was seen as a failure, more often than not.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, it’s accepted that systems evolve, perhaps in unexpected directions. Rapidly testing, failing fast, learning, and pivoting direction are all part of the lexicon, at least for market-facing IT-based products. And even back-office IT systems with better understood scope are being managed more as systems (or products) with lifecycles, as opposed to transient projects. (See the <a href="#amazon-productization">Amazon discussion</a>, below.)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is product management and what does it mean for your team?</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_defining_product_management">Defining Product Management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to define product management, we first need to define product. In Chapter 1, we established that products are goods, services, or some combination, with some feature that provides value for some consumer. BusinessDictionary.com <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product.html">defines it thus</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
[A Product is] A good, idea, method, information, object or service created as a result of a process and serves a need or satisfies a want. It has a combination of tangible and intangible attributes (benefits, features, functions, uses) that a seller offers a buyer for purchase. For example a seller of a toothbrush not only offers the physical product but also the idea that the consumer will be improving the health of their teeth . . . A good or service [must] closely meet the requirements of a particular market and yield enough profit to justify its continued existence.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product <em>management</em>, according to the <a href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/product-management.html#ixzz3bHCVkoWj">same source</a>, is</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
The organizational structure within a business that manages the development, marketing and sale of a product or set of products throughout the product life cycle. It encompasses the broad set of activities required to get the product to market and to support it thereafter.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management in the general sense often reports to the Chief Marketing Officer (CMO). It represents the fundamental strategy of the firm, in terms of its value proposition and viability. The product needs to reflect the enterprise’s strategy for creating and maintaining customers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product strategy for <strong>internally-facing</strong> products is usually <strong>not</strong> defined by the enterprise CMO. If it is a back-office product, then “business within a business” thinking may be appropriate. (Even the payroll system run by IT for HR is a “product,” in this view.) In such cases, there still is a need for someone to function as an "internal CMO" to the external "customers."</p>

<p>With <a href="#digital-transformation">digital transformation</a>, all kinds of industrial products have increasing amounts of “IT” in them.

<p>Product management includes research and development, which means that there is considerable uncertainty. This is of course also true of IT systems development.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of product design is focusing on the user, and what she or he needs. The concept of <strong>outcome</strong> is key. This is easier said than done.

Entire books have been written on the various tools and techniques for doing this, from  focus groups to ethnographic analysis.</p>

<p>However, Marty Cagan warns against confusing Product Management and Product Marketing. He defines the two as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>The product manager is responsible for defining—in detail—the product to be built, and validating that product with real customers and users. The product marketing person is responsible for telling the world about that product, including positioning, messaging and pricing, managing the product launch, providing tools for the sales channel to market and sell the product, and for leading key programs such as online marketing and influencer marketing programs.</em> <a href="#Cagan2008">[Cagan2008]</a>, pp. 10-11.</p>

<p>Amazon (the online bookseller) is an important influence in the modern trend towards product-centric IT management. First, the founder Jeff Bezos mandated that all software development should be <a href="http://apievangelist.com/2012/01/12/the-secret-to-amazons-success-internal-apis/">service-oriented</a>, and assume that the functionality being built might at some point be offered to external customers.</p>

<p>Second, a widely reported practice at Amazon.com is the <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3037542/productivity-hack-of-the-week-the-two-pizza-approach-to-productive-teamwork">limitation of product teams to between 5-7 people</a>, the number that can be fed by “two pizzas” (depending on how hungry they are).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reasons for this phenomenon have been studied and analyzed (see e.g. <a href="#Madachy2008">[Madachy2008]</a>) but in general it is due to the increased communication overhead of expanded teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product design work (of which software development is one form) is creative and highly dependent on tacit knowledge, interpersonal interactions, organizational culture, and other “soft” factors. Products, especially those with a significant IT component, can  be understood as socio-technical systems, often complex. This means that small changes to their components or interactions can have major effects on their overall behavior and value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This in turn means that newcomers to a product development organization can have a profound impact on the product. Getting them “up to speed” with the culture, mental models, and tacit assumptions of the existing team can be challenging and rarely is simple. And the bigger the team, the bigger the problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The net result of these two practices at Amazon (and now <a href="#fowler-quote">General Electric and many other companies</a>) is the creation of multiple nimble services that are decoupled from each other, constructed and supported by teams appropriately sized for optimal high-value interactions.</p>

<p>Face to face interactions, usually enabled by giving the team its own space, are seen as essential for collaboration. While there are various approaches to Agile, all concur that tight-knight, collaborative teams deliver the highest value outcomes. The collective problem-solving talent of a diverse group of individuals who are given space to self-organize and solve problems creatively is immense, and very possibly the highest value resource known to the modern organziation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, collaboration does not happen just because people are fed pizzas and work in a room together. Google has established that the most significant predictor of team performance is a sense of psychological safety (see sidebar).</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dedicated, cross-functional teams</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outcome (not deliverable/output) focus</p>

<li>
<p>Cultivating a sense of shared understanding</p>

<li>
<p>Avoiding toxic individuals (so-called "rockstars, gurus, and ninjas")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Permission to fail</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>(Other Lean UX principles such as small batch sizes and visualizing work will be discussed elsewhere; there is significant overlap between Lean UX and other schools of thought covered in this book.)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lean UX is an influential work among digital firms and summarizes modern development practices well, especially for small, team-based organizations with minimal external dependencies.

"Prescriptive" means detailed and precise. A doctor&#8217;s prescription is specific as to what medicine to take, how much, and when. A prescriptive method is similarly specific. "Agile software development" is not prescriptive; as currently published by the Agile Alliance, it is a collection of principles and ideas you may or may not use.<br>

By comparison, Scrum is prescriptive; it states roles and activities specifically and trainers and practitioners in general seek to follow the method completely and accurately.

<p>Scrum is appropriate to this chapter, as it is product-focused. It calls for the roles of:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>and avoids further elaboration of roles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum product owner is responsible for holding the product vision and seeing that the team executes the highest value work. To do this, the potential features for the product are maintained in a "backlog" that can be re-prioritized as necessary (rather than a large, fixed-scope project). The product owner also defines acceptance criteria for the backlog items.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Scrum Master, on the other hand, acts as a team coach, "guiding the team to ever-higher levels of cohesiveness, self-organization, and performance." <a href="#Sims2012">[Sims2012]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scrum uses specific practices and artifacts such as sprints, standups, reviews, the above-mentioned concept of backlog, burndown charts, and so forth. We will discuss some of these further in Chapter 5 (Work Management) along with Kanban, another popular approach for executing work.</p>
</div>

</li>
<li>
<p>Potentially shippable product increment is an important concept used to decouple the team’s development activity from downstream business planning. A PSI is a cohesive unit of functionality that <strong>could</strong> be delivered to the customer, but doing so is the decision of the product owner.</p>

</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are seven activities:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The “sprint” is a defined time period, typically two to four weeks, in which the development team executes on an agreed scope</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Sprint Planning is where the scope is agreed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Daily Scrum is traditionally held standing up, to maintain focus and ensure brevity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprint Execution is the development activity within the sprint</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sprint Review is the “public end of the sprint” when the stakeholders are invited to view the completed work</p>

<p>Scrum is well grounded in theory, although Scrum team members do not need to understand the theory to succeed with it. Like Lean UX, Scrum emphasizes high-bandwidth collaboration, dedicated multi-skilled teams, a product focus, and so forth.</p>

<p>Finally, a word on the product manager. <a href="#2.0.4.03-scrum">Scrum</a> is prescriptive around the product <strong>owner</strong> role, but does not identify a role for product <strong>manager</strong>.

Marty Cagan warns against this approach, recommending instead that the product manager and owner be the same person, separate from marketing <a href="#Cagan2008">[Cagan2008]</a>, pp. 7-8.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Chapter 3, we needed to consider the means for describing  <a href="#system-intent">system intent</a>. Even as a bare-bones startup, some formalization of this starts to emerge, at the very least in the form of test-driven development:</p>

<p>But, the assumption in our emergence model is that more formalized product management emerges with the formation of a team. As a team, we now need to expand "upstream" of the core delivery pipeline, so that we can collaborate and discover more effectively. Notice the grey box in the following:</p>

<p>The most important foundation for your newly formalized product discovery capability is that it must be <strong>empirical and hypothesis-driven</strong>. Too often, product strategy is based on the HIPPO: The Highest Paid Person&#8217;s Opinion.</p>

<p>The problem with relying on "gut feel" or personal opinions is that people&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;regardless of experience or seniority&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;perform poorly in assessing the likely outcome of their product ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some well known research on this topic was conducted by Microsoft&#8217;s Ronny Kohavi. In this research, Kohavi and team determiend that "only about 1/3 of ideas improve the metrics they were designed to improve." <a href="#Kohavi2009">[Kohavi2009]</a> As background, the same report cites that:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore critical to establish a strong practice of data-driven experimentation when forming a product team, and avoid any cultural acceptance of "gut feel" or deferring to HIPPOs.

<p>"Some products are better defined by the job they do than the customers they serve," in other words. <a href="#Traynor2016">[Traynor2016]</a> This is in contrast to many kinds of business and requirements analysis that focus on identifying different user personas (e.g. 45-55 married Black woman with children in the house). Jobs to be Done advocates argue that "The job, not the customer, is the fundamental unit of analysis" and that customer "hire" products to do a certain job. <a href="#Christensen2006">[Christensen2006]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To apply the Job to Be done approach, Des Traynor suggests filling in the blanks in the following <a href="#Traynor2016">[Traynor2016]</a> :</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Why do people hire your product?</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People hire your product to do the job of --------  every ---------- when ----------. The other applicants for this job are --------, --------, and --------, but your product will always get the job because of --------.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding the alternatives people have is key. It&#8217;s possible that the job can be fulfilled in multiple different ways. For example, people may want certain software run. This job can be undertaken through owning a computer (e.g. having a data center). It can also be managed by hiring someone else&#8217;s computer (e.g. using a Cloud provider). If one is not attentive and creative in thinking about the diverse ways jobs can be done, one is at risk for disruption.</p>

<p>The most important part of the impact map is to answer the question "Why are we doing this?" The impact map is intended to help keep the team focused on the most important objectives, and avoid less valuable activities and investments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in the above diagram, we see that a bank may have an overall business goal of customer retention. (It is much more expensive to gain a new customer, than to retain an existing one, and retention is a metric carefully measured and tracked at the highest levels of the business.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Through focus groups and surveys, the bank may determine that staying current with online services is important to retaining customers. Some of these services are accessed by home PCs, but increasingly customers want access via mobile devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These business drivers lead to the decision to invest in online banking applications for both the Apple and Android mobile platforms. This decision in turn will lead to further discovery, analysis, and design of the mobile applications.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One well-established method for product discovery is that of business analysis, formalized in the <em>Business Analysis Body of Knowledge</em> (BABOK), from the International Institute of Business Analysis <a href="#IIBA2015">[IIBA2015]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) defines business analysis as (p. 442):</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>The practice of enabling change in the context of an enterprise
by defining needs and recommending solutions that deliver value to
stakeholders</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BABOK is centrally concerned with the concept of requirements, and classifies them thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Business requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stakeholder requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Solution requirements</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>functional requirements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>non-functional requirements</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transition requirements</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>BABOK also provides a framework for understanding and managing the work of business analysts; in general it assumes that a BA capability will be established and that maturing such a capability is a desirable thing. This may run counter to the Scrum ideal of cross-functional, multi-skilled teams. Also as noted <a href="#system-intent">above</a>, the term "requirements" has fallen out of favor with some Agile thought leaders.</p>

They had to try making me out of different metals, and different ways to make me. This took some time and effort&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;longer than was planned, in fact. But it was always understood that there would need to be a cog in a certain place in the machine.</strong></p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>No. I will always be a cog. They might make a different machine, with different cogs, but they will not be me. Are you part of a machine?</strong></p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>No. I grew here because it suited me. I have continued to grow for a couple years. Eventually I may grow 20 feet tall, if the conditions remain good.

<div class="paragraph">

<p>The above parable is meant to illustrate two very different product development worlds. Some product development is constrained by the overall system it takes place within. Other product development has more freedom to grow in different directions&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;to "discover" the customer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cog represents the world of classic systems engineering&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a larger objective frames the effort, and the component occupies a certain defined place within it. And yet, it may still be challenging to design and build the component, which can be understood as a product in and of itself. Fast feedback is still required for the design and development process, even when the product is only a small component with a very specific set of requirements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The flower represents the market-facing digital product that may "pivot," grow and adapt according to conditions. It also is constrained, by available space and energy, but within certain boundaries has greater adaptability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither is better than the other, but they do require different approaches. In general, we are coming from a world that saw digital systems strictly as cogs, and moving towards a world in which digital systems are more flexible, dynamic, and adaptable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, when digital components have very well understood requirements, usually we purchase them from specialist providers (increasingly "as a service"). This results in increasing attention to the "flowers" of digital product design, as acquiring the "cogs" is relatively straightforward (more on this in the chapter 8 section on sourcing.).</p>

<p>Once we have discovered at least a direction for the product&#8217;s value proposition, and have started to understand the functions it must perform, we begin the activity of design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design, like most other topics in this survey text, is a broad and complex area with varying definitions and schools of thought. The Herbert Simon quote at the beginning of this Part Is frequently cited.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design is an ongoing theme throughout the humanities, encountered in architecture (the non-IT variety), art, graphics, fashion, and commerce. It can be narrowly focused, such as the question of what color scheme to use on an app or web page. Or it can be much more expansive, as suggested by the field of design thinking. We&#8217;ll start from the expansive vision and drill down into a few interesting topics.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design thinking is a recent trend with various definitions, but in general combines a design sensibility with problem solving at significant scale. It usually is understood to include a significant component of systems thinking. As Tom Fisher, author of <em>Designing Our Way to a Better World</em> <a href="#Fisher2016">[Fisher2016]</a>, notes:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of work in this area of “design thinking,” which takes the thought process and the methods that have been developed for millennia around the design of physical things — products, buildings, cities — and applies that to the so-called invisible world of design, which is all of the systems and organizations that are designed, but we don’t think of them as being designed. And we’re seeing a lot of these systems not working very well.</em><a href="#Peck2016">[Peck2016]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Design thinking is the logical evolution of disciplines such as user interface design, when such designs encounter constraints and issues beyond their usual span of concern. Although it has been influential on Lean UX and related works, it is not an explicitly digital discipline.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many design failures in digital product delivery. What is often overlooked is that the entire customer experience of the product is a form of design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider for example Apple Computer. Their products are admired worldwide and cited as examples of "good design." Often, however, this is only understood in terms of the physical product, for example an iPhone or a MacBook Air. But there is more to the experience. Suppose you have technical difficulties with your iPhone, or you just want to get more value out of it. Apple created its popular Genius Bar support service, where you can get support and instruction in using the technology.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the product you are using is no longer just the phone, or computer. <strong>It is the combination of the device PLUS your support experience</strong>. This is essential to understanding the modern practices of design thinking and Lean UX. As Jeff Sussna, author of <em>Designing Delivery</em>, notes, "In order to provide high-quality, digitally infused service, the entire delivery organization must function as an integrated whole." <a href="#Sussna2015">[Sussna2015]</a>, p. 18.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_hypothesis_testing">Hypothesis testing</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of hypothesis testing is key to product discovery and design. The power of scalable Cloud architectures and fast Continuous Delivery pipelines has made it possible to test product hypotheses against real-world customers at scale and in real time. Companies like Netflix and Facebook have pioneered techniques like "canary deployments" and "A/B testing."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In these approaches, two different feature approaches are tried out simultaneously and the business results are measured. For example, are customers more likely to click on a green button or a yellow one? Testing such questions in the era of packaged software would have required lab-based usability engineering approaches, which risked being invalid because of their small sample size. Testing against larger numbers is possible, now that software is increasingly delivered as a service.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_usability_and_interaction">Usability and interaction</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a lower level than the holistic concerns of design thinking, we have practices such as usability engineering. These take many forms. There are any number of systematic and well-researched approaches to</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>usability, interaction design (<a href="#Cooper2009">[Cooper2009]</a>, <a href="#Isaacs2002">[Isaacs2002]</a>, <a href="#Tidwell2006">[Tidwell2006]</a>, <a href="#Bank2016">[Bank2016]</a>)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>and related topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All such approaches, however, should be used in the overall Lean Startup/Lean UX framework of hypothesis generation and testing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we subscribe to design thinking and take a whole-systems view, designing for ease of operations is also part of the design process. We will discuss this further in Chapter 6. Developing documentation of the product&#8217;s characteristics, from the perspective of those who will run it on a day to day basis, is also an aspect of product delivery.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with most other chapters in this book, this brief survey cannot do justice to such a broad field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product-centric thinking is at the core of delivering digital value. Without a clear understanding of the product and its context, investments of time and resources are at risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product management requires close collaboration between individuals of different skills. Team structures, practices, and culture are critical factors for success. Establishing an experimental mindset is essential; research shows that product ideas must be validated as expert opinion is of minimal value.</p>

Beyond your product strategy, you have support calls increasingly coming in that result in fixes and new features, and it&#8217;s all getting complicated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You already have a product owner. You now institute <a href="#_scrum">Scrum</a> practices of a managed backlog, daily standups and sprints. You may also use Kanban-style task boards or card walls (to be described in this chapter), which are essential for things like support-driven work. The relationship of these to your Scrum practices is a matter of some ongoing debate. You don&#8217;t think you need full-blown project management&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;yet. You also may become aware of the idea of "ticketing," if you have people with previous service desk experience. How this relates to your Scrum/Kanban approach is a question.</p>

<p>Furthermore, while we covered Agile principles and practices in some detail in chapters 3 and 4, we did not discuss <strong>why</strong> they work. In this chapter, we will cover the Lean theory of product management that provides a basis for Agile practices, in particular the work of Don Reinertsen.</p>

<p>The chapter title "Work Management" reflects earlier stages of organizational growth. At this point, neither formal project management, nor a fully realized process framework are needed, and the organization may not see a need to distinguish precisely between types of work processes.

<p>The product development process drives a wide variety of work activities. As your product matures, you encounter both routine and non-routine work. Some of the work depends on other work getting done. Sometimes you do not realize this immediately. All of this work needs to be tracked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work management may start with verbal requests, emails, even postal mail. If you ask your colleague to do one thing, and she doesn’t have anything else to do, it’s likely that the two of you will remember. If you ask her to do four things over a few days, you <strong>might</strong> both still remember. But if you are asking for new things every day, it is likely that some things will get missed. You each might start keeping your own “to do” list, and this mechanism can handle a dozen or two dozen tasks. Consider an example of three people, each with their own to do list:</p>

<p>In this situation, each person has their own “mental model” of what needs to be done, and their own tracking mechanism. We don’t know how the work is being transmitted: emails, phone calls, hallway conversations (”Say Joe, there is an issue with Customer X’s bill, can you please look into it?”)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what happens when there are three of you? Mary asks Aparna to do something and in order to complete it she needs something from Joe, whom Mary is also asking to complete other tasks. As an organization scales, this can easily lead to confusion and "dropped balls."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point, you need to formalize your model of the work, how it is described, and how it flows. This is such a fundamental problem in human society that many different systems, tools, and processes have been developed over the centuries to address it.
Probably the most important is the shared task reference point. What does this mean? The “task” is made "real" by associating it with a common, agreed-on artifact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="representation"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, a “ticket” may be created, or a "work order." Or a “story,” written down on a sticky note. At our current level of understanding, there is little difference between these concepts. <strong>The important thing they have in common is an independent existence.</strong> That is, Mary, Aparna, and Joe might all change jobs, but the artifact persists independently of them. Notice also that the artifact - the ticket, the post-it note - is <strong>not</strong> the actual task, which is an intangible, consensus concept. It is a <em>representation</em> of this intangible "intent to perform." We will discuss these issues of representation further in Chapter 11.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A complex IT-based system is not needed, if you are all in the same room! (Nor for that matter a complex process framework, such as <a href="#ITIL">ITIL</a> or <a href="#COBIT">COBIT</a>. There is risk in using such frameworks at this stage of evolution - they add too much overhead for your level of growth.) It&#8217;s also still too early for formal project management. The "project team" would be most or all of the organization, so what would be the point? A shared white board in a public location might be all that is needed. This gives the team a “shared mental model” of who is doing what.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 46. Common list</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of the task board above has some issues, however. After the team gets tired of erasing and rewriting the tasks and their current assignments, they might adopt something more like this:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The board itself might be a white board, or a cork bulletin board with push pins. The notes could be sticky, or index cards. There are automated solutions as well. The tool doesn’t really matter. The important thing is that, at a glance, the entire team can see its flow of work and who is doing what.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is sometimes called a “Kanban board," although David Anderson (originator of the Kanban software method) himself terms the basic technique a "card wall." It also has been called a "Scrum Board." The board at its most basic is not specific to either methodology. The term "Kanban" itself derives from Lean manufacturing principles; we will cover this in depth in the next section. The basic board is widely used because it is a powerful artifact. Behind its deceptive simplicity is considerable industrial experience and relevant theory from operations management and human factors. However, it has scalability limitations. What if the team is not all in the same room? We will cover this and related issues in Part III.</p>

<p>To understand Kanban let&#8217;s discuss Lean briefly. We&#8217;ve had passing mention of Lean already in this book. But what is it?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lean is a term invented by some American researchers who investigated Japanese industrial practices and their success in the 20th century. After the end of World War II, no-one expected the Japanese economy to recover the way it did. The recovery is credited to practices invented by  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno">Taiichi Ohno</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeo_Shingo">Shigeo Shingo</a> at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota">Toyota</a>.

</ul>
</div>

<p>Kanban is a term originating from Lean and the Toyota Production System. Originally, it signified a “pull” technique in which materials would only be transferred to a given workstation on a definite signal that the workstation required the materials. This was in contrast to “push” approaches where work was allowed to accumulate on the shop floor, on the (now discredited) idea that it was more “efficient” to operate workstations at maximum capacity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factories operating on a "push" model found themselves with massive amounts of inventory (work in process) in their facilities. This tied up operating capital and resulted in long delays to shipment. Japanese companies did not have the luxury of large amounts of operating capital, so they started experimenting with "single-piece flow." This led to a number of related innovations, such as the ability to re-configure manufacturing machinery much more quickly than U.S. factories were capable of.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>David J. Anderson was a product manager at Microsoft who was seeking a more effective approach to managing software development. In consultation with Don Reinertsen (introduced in the <a href="#queuing">below</a>) he applied the original concept of Kanban to his software development activities <a href="#Anderson2010">[Anderson2010]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#scrum">Scrum</a> (covered in the previous chapter) is based on a rhythm with its scheduled sprints, for example every two weeks. In contrast, Kanban is a continuous process with no specified rhythm (also known as <em>cadence</em>). Work is “pulled” from backlog into active attention as resources are freed from previous work. This is perhaps the most important aspect of Kanban - the idea that <strong>work is not accepted until there is capacity to perform it.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have a white board covered with sticky notes, but if they are stacked on top of each other with no concern for worker availability, you are not doing Kanban. You are accepting too much work in process and you are likely to encounter a "high-queue state" in which work becomes slower and slower to get done. (More on <a href="#queuing">queues</a> below.)</p>

<h5 id="_the_theory_of_constraints">The Theory of Constraints</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eliyahu Moshe Goldratt was an Israeli physicist and management consultant, best known for his pioneering work in management theory, including  <em>The Goal</em>, which is a best-selling business novel frequently assigned in MBA programs. It and Goldratt&#8217;s other novels have had a tremendous effect on industrial theory, and now, digital management. One of the best known stories in <em>The Goal</em> centers around a Boy Scout march. Alex, the protagonist struggling to save his manufacturing plant, takes a troop of Scouts on a ten mile hike. The troop has hikers of various speeds, yet the goal is to arrive simultaneously. As Alex tries to keep the Scouts together, he discovers that the slowest, most overweight scout (Herbie) also has packed an unusually heavy backpack. The contents of Herbie&#8217;s pack are redistributed, speeding up both Herbie and the troop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This story summarizes the Goldratt approach: finding the "constraint" to production (his work as a whole is called the Theory of Constraints). In Goldratt&#8217;s view, a system is only as productive as its constraint. At Alex&#8217;s factory, it&#8217;s found that the "constraint" to the overall productivity issues is the newest computer-controlled machine tool&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;one that could (in theory) do the work of several older models but was now jeopardizing the entire plant&#8217;s survival. This novelization parallels in important regards actual Lean case studies on the often-negative impact of such capital-intensive approaches to production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is a tremendous wealth of material available on Lean history and theory, and the IT student is urged to become familiar with it. Often, IT professionals resist drawing lessons from non-IT fields, because of a perception that these other fields (especially manufacturing) are “deterministic” while IT systems development is too “uncertain.” In reality, manufacturing is less deterministic than IT professionals often perceive, while software development is, at its most uncertain, just another form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_product_development">new product development</a>, and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development">research and development</a> and therefore can be managed on that basis. Furthermore, much IT work is not R&amp;D (e.g. infrastructure provisionings), and that kind of work is even more suited for the application of manufacturing insights.</p>

<p>Between 2005 and 2012, I was a lead enterprise architect at Wells Fargo Bank, primarily concerned with IT delivery capabilities such as portfolio and service management. One day around 2007, I arrived at my office to find an envelope from my friend Gene Kim, then CTO of Tripwire. Gene and I had been corresponding for some years on high-performing IT, IT process improvement, and related topics. In the envelope was a copy of a book called <em>The Goal</em>, by Eli Goldratt. I was a little mystified, but after reading the book I began to understand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gene saw the potential of the Theory of Constraints in understanding certain aspects of information technology management, and used it as a template to write another remarkable and influential book, <em>The Phoenix Project</em> <a href="#Kim2013">[Kim2013]</a>. Rather than a manufacturing plant, the Phoenix Project centers on the struggles of the IT team at a medium-sized automotive parts manufacturer and retailer. From a state of chaos, uncontrolled work in process and resource constraints, the team applies Lean, Agile, and DevOps techniques to great effect. In my view, <em>The Phoenix Project</em> is one of the most important works in the history of IT and digital management, and is also an enjoyable novel. I am honored to have been one of the original reviewers. If you are considering a career in IT or digital, it is essential reading. See especially Chapter 30 for an interesting discussion of manufacturing lessons in an IT context.</p>

Queues matter because they are economically important, they are poorly managed, and they have the potential to be much better managed. Queues profoundly affect the economics of product development. They cause valuable work products to sit idle, waiting to access busy resources. This idle time increases inventory, which is the root cause of many other economic problems&#8230;&#8203;queues hurt cycle time, quality, and efficiency.

<p>Even at this stage of our evolution, with just one co-located collaborative team, it’s important to consider work in progress and how to limit it. One topic we will emphasize throughout the rest of this book is <em>queuing</em>. What is a queue? A queue, intuitively, is a collection of tasks to be done, being serviced by some worker or resource in some sequence, for example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>feature "stories" being developed by a product team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>customer requests coming into a service desk</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The amount of time that any given work item spends in the queue, is proportional to how busy the servicing resource is. The simple formula is</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Wait time = (% Busy) * (% Idle)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In other words, if you divide the percentage of busy time for the resource, by its idle time, you see the average wait time. So, if a resource is busy 40% of the days, but idle 60% of the days, the average time you wait for the resource is</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>0.4/0.6= 0.67 hours (2/3 of a day).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conversely, if a resource is busy 95% of the time, the average time you&#8217;ll wait is</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>0.95/0.5 = 5.67 (19 days!)</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice how the wait time approaches infinity as the queue utilization approaches 100%. And yet, full utilization of resources is often sought by managers in the name of "efficiency." These basic principles are discussed by Gene Kim et al in the <em>Phoenix Project</em> <a href="#Kim2013">[Kim2013]</a> in Chapter 23, and more rigorously by Don Reinertsen in <em>The Principles of Product Development Flow</em> <a href="#Reinertsen2009">[Reinertsen2009]</a>, chapter 3. A further complication is when work must pass through multiple queues; wait times for work easily expand to weeks or months. Such scenarios are not hypothetical, they are often seen in the real world and are a fundamental cause of information technology organizations getting a bad name for being slow and unresponsive. Fortunately, digital professionals are gaining insight into these dynamics and (as of 2016) matters are improving across the industry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Understanding queuing behavior is critical to productivity. Reinertsen suggests that poorly managed queues contribute to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Longer cycle time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased risk</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More variability</p>

<li>
<p>More overhead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lower quality</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Less motivation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These issues were understood by the pioneers of Lean manufacturing, an important movement throughout the 20th century. One of its central principles is to limit work in process. Work in process is obvious on a shop floor, because physical raw materials (inventory) are quite visible.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don Reinertsen developed the insight that product design and development had an <strong>invisible</strong> inventory of "Work in Process" that he called Design in Process (DIP). Just as managing physical work in process on the factory floor is key to a factory&#8217;s success, so correctly understanding and managing design in process is essential to all kinds of research and development organizations&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;<strong>including digital product development, e.g. building software(!)</strong> In fact, because digital systems are largely invisible even when finished, understanding their work in process is even more challenging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is easy and tempting for a product development team to accumulate excessive amounts of work in process. And, to some degree, having a rich backlog of ideas is an asset. But, just as some inventory (e.g. groceries) is perishable, so are design ideas. They have a limited time in which they might be relevant to a customer or a market. Therefore, accumulating too many of them at any point in time can be wasteful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this have to do with queuing? Design in process is one form of queue seen in the digital organization. Other forms include unplanned work (incidents and defects), implementation work, and many other concepts we&#8217;ll discuss in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Regardless of whether it is a "Requirement," a "User Story," an "Epic," "Defect,", "Issue," or "Service Request," you should remember it&#8217;s <strong>all just work.</strong> It needs to be logged, prioritized, assigned, and tracked to completion. Queues are the fundamental concept for doing this, and it&#8217;s critical that digital management specialists understand this.</p>

<p>We will revisit the topic of queuing in Chapter 9. For now, some rules of thumb:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finish what you start, if you can, before starting anything else. When you work on three things at once, the multi-tasking wastes time and it takes you three times longer to get any one of the things done. (More on <a href="#multi-tasking">multi-tasking</a> in this chapter.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Infinitely long to-do lists (backlog) sap motivation. Consider limiting backlog as well as work in process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visibility into work in progress is important for the collective mental model of the team.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are deeper philosophical and cultural qualities to Kanban beyond workflow and queuing. Anderson and his colleagues continue to evolve Kanban into a more ambitious framework. Mike Burrows <a href="#Burrows2014">[Burrows2014]</a> identifies the following key principles</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Start with what you do now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agree to pursue evolutionary change.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initially, respect current processes, roles, responsibilities, and job titles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage acts of leadership at every level in your organization —from individual contributor to senior management.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can see in comparing Scrum and Kanban that their areas of focus are somewhat different.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scrum is widely adopted in industry and has achieved a level of formalization, which is why Scrum training is widespread and generally consistent in content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kanban is more flexible but this comes at a cost of more management overhead. It requires more interpretation to translate to a given organization’s culture and practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Scrum author Ken Rubin notes, “Scrum is not well suited to highly interrupt-driven work.” <a href="#Rubin2012">[Rubin2012]</a>. Scrum on the service desk doesn&#8217;t work. (But if your company is too small, it may be difficult to segregate out interrupt-driven work! We will discuss the issues around interrupt-driven work further in Chapter 6.)</p>

As simple as the whiteboard is, it makes WIP continuously visible, it enforces WIP constraints, it creates synchronized daily interaction, and it promotes interactive problem solving. Furthermore, teams evolve methods of using whiteboards continuously, and they have high ownership in their solution. In theory, all this can be replicated by a computer system. In practice, I have not yet seen an automated system the replicates the simple elegance and flexibility of a manual system.

<p>Why are shared visual representations important? Depending on how you measure, between 40% to as much as 80% of the human cortex is devoted to visual processing. Visual processing dominates mental activity, consuming more neurons than the other four senses combined <a href="#Sells1957">[Sells1957]</a>. Visual representations are powerful communication mechanisms, well suited to our cognitive abilities.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why <a href="#card-wall">card walls</a> or Kanban boards located in the same room are so prevalent. They communicate and sustain the shared mental model of a human team. A shared card wall, with its two dimensions and tasks on cards or sticky notes, is more informative than a simple to-do list (e.g.  in a spreadsheet). The cards occupy two dimensional space and are  moved over time to signify activity, both powerful cues to the human visual processing system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, monitoring tools for systems operation make use of various visual clues. Large monitors may be displayed prominently on walls, so that everyone can understand operational status. Human visual orientation is also why Enterprise Architecture persists. People will always draw to communicate. (More on <a href="#arch-visualization">visualization and enterprise architecture </a>in Chapter 12.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Card walls and publicly displayed monitors are both examples of <em>information radiators</em>. The information radiator concept derives from the Japanese concept of <em>Andon</em>, important in Lean thinking.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<em>Andon</em> is a manufacturing term referring to a system to notify management, maintenance, and other workers of a quality or process problem. The centrepiece is a signboard incorporating signal lights to indicate which workstation has the problem. The alert can be activated manually by a worker using a pullcord or button, or may be activated automatically by the production equipment itself. The system may include a means to stop production so the issue can be corrected. Some modern alert systems incorporate audio alarms, text, or other displays.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Andon <em>Cord</em> (not to be confused with Andon in the general sense) is another well known concept in Lean Manufacturing. It originated with Toyota, where line workers were empowered to stop the production line if any defective materials or assemblies were encountered. Instead of attempting to work with the defective input, the entire line would shut down and all concerned would establish what had happened and how to prevent it. The concept of andon cord concisely summarizes the Lean philosophy of employee responsibility for quality at all levels <a href="#Ohno1988">[Ohno1988]</a>. Where Andon is a general term for information radiator, the Andon Cord implies a dramatic reponse to the problems of flow - all progress is stopped, everywhere along the line, and the entire resources of the production line are marshalled to collaboratively solve the issue so that it does not happen again. As Toyota though leader Taiichi Ohno states:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Stopping the machine when there is trouble forces awareness on everyone. When the problem is clearly understood, improvement is possible. Expanding this thought, we establish a rule that even in a manually operated production line, the workers themselves should push the stop button to halt production if any abnormality appears.

<p>Andon and information radiators provide important stimulus for product teams, informing priorities and prompting responses. They do not prescribe what is to be done; they simply indicate operational status that may require attention.</p>

<h5 id="_definition_of_done">Definition of done</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As work flows through the system performing it, understanding its status is key to managing it. One of the most important mechanisms for doing this is to simply define what is meant by “done.” The Agile Alliance <a href="http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/definition-of-done.html#sthash.6rSCZMyU.dpuf">states</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“The team agrees on, and displays prominently somewhere in the team room, a list of criteria which must be met before a product increment, often a user story, is considered "done" <a href="#Alliance2016">[Alliance2016]</a>. Failure to meet these criteria at the end of a sprint normally implies that the work should not be counted toward that sprint&#8217;s velocity.” There are various patterns for defining "done," for example, Thoughtworks recommends that the business analyst and developer both must agree that some task is complete (it is not up to just one person). Other companies may require peer code reviews <a href="#Narayam2015a">[Narayam2015a]</a>. The important point is that the team must agree on the criteria.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This idea of defining “done” can be extended by the team to other concepts such as “blocked.” The important thing is that this is all part of the team’s shared mental model, and is best defined by the team and its customers. (However, governance and consistency concerns may arise if teams are too diverse in such definitions.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_time_and_space_shifting">Time and space shifting</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point your team will be faced with the problems of time and/or space shifting. People will be on different schedules, or in different locations, or both. There are two things we know about such working relationships. First, they leads to sub-optimal team communications and performance. Second, they are inevitable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The need for time and space shifting is one of the major drivers for more formalized IT systems. It is difficult to effectively use a physical Kanban board if people aren’t in the office. The outcome of the daily standup needs to be captured for the benefit of those who could not be there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, acceptance of time and space shifting may lead to more of it, even when it is not absolutely required. A constant pressure and questioning is recommended, given the superior bandwidth of face to face communication in the context of team collaboration.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But not all work requires the same degree of collaboration. While we are still not ready for full scale process management, at this point in our evolution we likely will encounter increasing needs to track customer or user service interations, which can become quite numerous even for small, single-team organizations. Such work is often more more individualized and routine.  This brings us to the topic of the Help or Service Desk.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_service_desk_and_related_tools">The service desk and related tools</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a digital product starts to gain a user base, and as a company matures and grows, there emerges a need for human to human support. This is typically handled by a help desk or service desk. The Service Desk (aka Help Desk), is the human face of IT when the IT systems are not meeting people&#8217;s expectations. We were first briefly introduced to the concept in our Service Lifecycle:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/1.01-ITStates.png" alt="1.01 ITStates">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 53. IT service lifecycle</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The service desk is an interrupt-driven, task-oriented capability. It serves as a first point of contact for IT services that require some human support or intervention. As such its role can become broad, from provisioning access to assisting users in navigation &amp; usage, to serving as an alert channel for outage reporting. The service desk ideally answers each user&#8217;s request immediately, requiring no followup. If followup is required, a "ticket" is "issued."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As a “help desk,” it may be focused on end user assistance and reporting Incidents.
As a “service desk,” it may expand its purview to accepting provisioning or other requests of various types (and referring and tracking those requests). Note that in some approaches, Service Request and Incident are considered to be distinct processes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term "ticket" dates to paper-based industrial processes, where the "help desk" might actually be a physical desk, where a user seeking services might be issued a paper ticket. Such "tickets" were also used in field services:</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 54. A "ticket" from early industry</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IT-centric domains, tickets are virtual; they are records in databases, not paper. The user is given a ticket "ID" or "number" for tracking (e.g., so they can inquire about the request&#8217;s status.) The ticket may be "routed" to someone to handle, but again in a virtual world what really happens is that the person it&#8217;s routed to is directed to look at the record in the database. (In paper based processes, the ticket might well be moved physically to various parties to perform the needed work.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A Service Desk capability needs</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>channels for accepting contacts (e.g. telephone, email, chat),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>staffing appropriate to the volume and nature of those requests,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>robust workflow capabilities to track their progress, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>routing and escalation mechanisms, since clarifying the true nature of contacts and getting them serviced by the most appropriate means are nontrivial challenges.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work management in practice has divided between development and operations practices and tools. However, DevOps and Kanban are forcing a reconsideration and consolidation. Historically, here are some of the major tools and channels through which tasks and work are managed on both sides:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these systems have common characteristics. All can (or should) be able to:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Register a new task</p>

<p>The first automated system (computer-based) you may find yourself acquiring along these lines is a help desk system. You may be a small company, but when you start to build a large customer base, keeping them all happy requires more than a manual, paper-based card wall or Kanban board.</p>

<p>The root cause of this debate is the distinction between product development and production. It is true that an industrial production line, for example producing forklifts by the thousands, may be repetitive. But how did the production line come to be? How was the forklift invented, or developed? It was created as part of a process of product development. It took mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemistry, materials science, and more.  Combining fundamental engineering principles and techniques into a new, marketable product is not a repetitive process; it is a highly variable, creative process, and always has been.</p>

<cite>Principles of Product Development Flow</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don Reinertsen is well known for advocating the concept of "Cost of Delay" in understanding product economics. The term is intuitive; it represents the loss one experiences by delaying the delivery of some value. For example, if a delayed product misses a key trade show, and therefore its opportunity to launch against competitors, the cost of delay might be the entire market. Understanding Cost of Delay is part of a broader economic emphasis that Reinertsen brings to the general question of product development. He suggests that product developers, in general, do not understand the fundamental economics of their decisions regarding resources and work in progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand Cost of Delay, it is first necessary to think in terms of a market-facing product (such as a smart phone application). Any market facing product can be represented in terms of its lifecycle revenues and profits:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-lifecycle-table.png" alt="2.05 lifecycle table">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 57. Product lifecycle economics by year</div>
</div>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-lifecycle-graph.png" alt="2.05 lifecycle graph">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 58. Product lifecycle economics, charted</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The numbers above represent a product lifecycle, from R&amp;D through production to retirement. The first year is all cost, as the product is being developed, and net profits are negative. In year 2, a small net profit is shown, but cumulative profit is still negative, as it remains in year 3. Only into year 3 does the product break even, ultimately achieving lifecycle net earnings of 175.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what if the product&#8217;s introduction into the market is delayed? The consequences can be severe.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply delaying delivery by a year, all things being equal in our example, will reduce lifeycle profits by 30%:</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 60. Product lifecycle, simple delay, charted</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But all things are not equal. What if, in delaying the product for a year, we allow a competitor to gain a superior market position? That could depress our sales and increase our per-unit costs - both bad:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Advanced Cost of Delay analysis argues that different product lifecycles have different characteristics. Josh Arnold of Black Swan Farming has visualized these as a set of profiles <a href="#Arnold2013">[Arnold2013]</a>. The simple delay profile appears like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-simpleCOD.png" alt="delay curve 1" width="400">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 63. Simple Cost of Delay</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this delay curve, while profits and revenues are lost due to late entry, it&#8217;s assumed that the product will still enjoy its expected market share. We can think of this as the "iPhone versus Android" profile, as Android was later but still achieved market parity. The aggravated cost of delay profile, however, looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.05-aggroCOD.png" alt="delay curve 2" width="400">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 64. Aggravated Cost of Delay</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this version, the failure to enter the market in a timely way results in long term loss of market share. We can think of this as the "Amazon Kindle versus Barnes &amp; Noble Nook" profile, as the Nook has not achieved parity, and does not appear likely to. There are other delay curves imaginable, such as delay curves for tightly time limited products (e.g. such as found in the fashion industry) or cost of delay that&#8217;s only incurred after a specific date (such as in complying with a regulation.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reinertsen observes that product managers may think that they intuitively understand Cost of Delay, but when he asks them to estimate the aggregate cost of (for example) delaying their product&#8217;s delivery by a given period of time, the estimates provided by product team participants <strong>in a position to delay delivery</strong> may vary by up to 50:1. This is powerful evidence that a more quantitative approach is essential, as opposed to relying on "gut feel" or the <a href="#HIPPO">Highest Paid Person&#8217;s Opinion</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Josh Arnold notes that Cost of Delay is much easier to assess on small batches of work. Large projects tend to attract many ideas for features, some of which have stronger economic justifications than others. When all these features are lumped together, it makes understanding Cost of Delay challenging, because it then becomes an average across the various features. But since features, ideally, can be worked on individually, understanding Cost of Delay at that level helps with the prioritization of the work.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But consider a day in the life in the modern corporation: dozens or hundreds of cross functional processes that have become a daily barrage of work on the people housed in the functional areas. Driven by back end automation, front ended by automated (or even manual) email notifications, these required activities include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<li>
<p>service requests,</p>

<p>and more - infinitely more. This is the modern, “process"-centric enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>True, any one of these processes is (often) a relatively small burden to perform. Taken together, however, it’s the nightmare of <a href="http://www.waywordradio.org/adminisdribble_1/">Adminisdribble</a>: The daily death by a thousand cuts of required, cross-functional process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Continual context switching. End to end flow in concept across functions, but little experienced by the multitasking individual. Invisible, unmanaged demand. A thousand channels for flow, but no throughput, because of gridlock.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What drives this? The combination of permanent downsizing, continually increasing governance &amp; compliance burdens, and the assumption that the enterprise can always tolerate another process. Overall organizational capacity is rarely considered, especially for “supporting" processes. And there is no appreciation for the emergent behavior when these myriads of processes interact in unexpected ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why kanban is so radical. Within a limited scope, it is starting to challenge the IT management dogma at least. User stories, incidents, defects, service requests, changes… they are all “just work.” Just another sticky note on the board. Someone has to perform the work; someone has to allocate time and attention to it. A simple but utterly profound change in orientation. Kanban is the labor movement of the 21st century.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It seems to me that true “respect for people” (as advocated by Lean) of course must start with the recognition that work takes people’s time. I think the modern, process centric enterprise has lost sight of that reality. Is Kanban the answer?</p>

<p><em>Instructor&#8217;s note</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although this chapter is titled "operations management" it also brings in infrastructure engineering at a higher level, assuming that the product is continuing to scale up. Chapter 12 touches on architecture and technical debt as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_introduction_6">Introduction</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As your product gains more use, you find that running it inevitably becomes a distinct concern from building it. For all their logic, computers are still surprisingly unreliable. Servers running well tested software may remain "up" for weeks, and then all of a sudden hang and have to be rebooted. Sometimes it&#8217;s clear why (for example, a log file filled up that no-one expected) and in other cases there just is no explanation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Engineering and operating complex IT-based distributed systems is a significant challenge. Even with <a href="#infracode">infrastructure as code</a> and automated <a href="#continuous-delivery">continuous delivery</a> pipelines, operations as a class of work is distinct from software development per se. The work is relatively more interrupt-driven, as compared to the "heads-down" focus of developing new features. Questions of scalability, performance, caching, load balancing, and so forth usually become apparent first through feedback from the operations perspective&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;whether or not you have a formal operations "team."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are still just one team with one product, but as we enter this last chapter of Part II, the assumption is that we have considerable use of our product. With today&#8217;s technology, correctly deployed and operated, even a small team can support large workloads. This does not come easily, however. Systems must be designed for scale and ease of operations. They need to be monitored, managed for performance and capacity. We will also revisit the topic of configuration management at a more advanced level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We discussed the evolution of infrastructure in <a href="#chapter-2">Chapter 2</a> and applications development in <a href="#chapter-3">Chapter 3</a>, and will continue to build on those foundations. The practices of Change, Incident, and Problem management have been employed in the industry for decades and are important foundations for thinking about operations. The concept of Site Reliability Engineering is an important new discipline emerging from the practices of companies such as Google and Facebook. We will examine its principles and practices.</p>

<p>What do we mean by operations? Operations management is a broad topic in management theory, with whole programs dedicated to it in both business and engineering schools. Companies frequently hire Chief Operations Officers to run the organization. We started to cover operations management in chapter 5, as we examined the topic of “work management” - in traditional operations management, the question of work and who is doing it is critical. For the digital professional, “operations” tends to have a more technical meaning than the classic business definition, being focused on the immediate questions of systems integrity, availability and performance, and feedback from the user community (i.e., the service or help desk). We see such a definition from Limoncelli et al:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>operations is the work done to keep a system running in a way that meets or exceeds operating parameters specified by a service level agreement (SLA). Operations includes all aspects of a service’s life cycle: from initial launch to the final decommissioning and everything in between.</em> <a href="#Limoncelli2014">[Limoncelli2014]</a>, p. 147.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Operations often can mean, “everything but development” in a digital context. In the classic model, developers built systems and "threw them over the wall" to operations. Each side had specialized processes and technology supporting their particular concerns. However, recall our discussion of <a href="#design">design thinking</a>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the entire experience is part of the product. This applies to both those consuming it as well as running it. Companies undergoing digital transformation are experimenting with many different models; as we will see in <a href="#Section-III-coordination">Part III</a>, up to and including the complete merging of Development and Operations-oriented skills under common product management.</p>

<p>As above, the primary thing that operations does NOT do is develop new systems functionality. Operations is process-driven and systematic, where research and development fails the "systematic" part of the definition (review the definitions in <a href="#2.04.01-process-project-product">process, product, and project management</a>). However, new functionality usually has operational impacts. In manufacturing and other traditional industries, product development was a minority of work, while operations was where the bulk of work happened. Yet when an operational task involving information becomes well defined and repetitive, it can be automated with a computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This continuous cycle of innovation and commoditization has driven closer and closer ties between “development” and “operations.” This cycle also has driven confusion around exactly what is meant by “operations.” In many organizations, there is an “Infrastructure and Operations” function. Pay close attention to the naming. A matrix may help, because we have two dimensions to consider here.</p>

<h5 id="_the_concept_of_service_level">The concept of "service level"</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A digital system is either available and providing a service, or it isn&#8217;t. The concept of "service level" was mentioned above by Limoncelli. A level of service is typically defined in terms of criteria such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What % of time will the service be available?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the service suffers an outage, how long until it will be restored?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How fast will the service respond to requests?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>service level agreement</em>, or SLA, is a form of contract between the service consumer and service provider, stating the above criteria in terms of a business agreement. When a service&#8217;s performance does not meet the agreement, this is sometimes called a "breach" and the service provider may have to pay a penalty (e.g., the customer gets a 5% discount on that month&#8217;s services.) If the service provider exceeds the SLA, perhaps a credit will be issued.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SLAs drive much operational behavior. They help prioritize Incidents and Problems, and the risk of proposed Changes are  understood in terms of the SLAs.</p>

<p>Limoncelli, Chalup, and Hogan, in their excellent <em>Cloud Systems Administration</em>, emphasize the role of the "oncall" and "onduty" staff in the service of operations <a href="#Limoncelli2014">[Limoncelli2014]</a>. <em>Oncall</em> staff have a primary responsibility of emergency response, and the term oncall refers to their continuous availability, even if they are not otherwise working (e.g., they are expected to pick up phone calls and alerts at home and dial into emergency communications channels). <em>Onduty</em> staff are responsible for responding to non-critical incidents and maintaining current operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is an emergency? It&#8217;s all a matter of expectations. If a system (by its SLA) is supposed to be available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, an outage at 3 AM Saturday morning is an emergency. If it is only supposed to be available between Monday through Friday, the outage may not be as critical (although it still needs to be fixed in short order, otherwise there will soon be an SLA breach!)</p>

By the 1990s, a terminology had been formalized, by vendors such as IBM (in their "Yellow Book" series), the United Kingdom&#8217;s IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL), and other guidance such as the Harris Kern library (popular in the United States before ITIL gained dominance).

<p>But how does one “observe” computing infrastructure? Clearly, sitting in the data center (assuming you could get in) and looking at the lights on the faces of servers will not convey much useful information, beyond whether they are off or on. Monitoring tools are the software that watches the software (and systems more broadly).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A variety of techniques are used to monitor computing infrastructure. Typically these involve communication over a network with the device being managed. Often, the network traffic is over the same network carrying the primary traffic of the computers. Sometimes, however, there is a distinct "out of band" network for management traffic. A simple monitoring tool will interact on a regular basis with a computing node, perhaps by “pinging” it periodically, and will raise an alert if the node does not respond within an expected time frame.</p>

<p>Some monitoring covers low level system indicators not usually of direct interest to the end user. Other monitoring may attempt to synthetically re-create the user&#8217;s "moment of truth." Web application response time monitoring, in which synthetic transactions are run as proxies for end user experience, is an example of this. See <a href="#Limoncelli2014">[Limoncelli2014]</a>, chapters 16-17.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this data may then be forwarded to a central console and be integrated, with the objective of supporting the organization’s service level agreements in priority order. Enterprise monitoring tools are notorious for requiring agents (small, continuously-running programs) on servers; while some things can be detected without such agents, having software running on a given computer still provides the richest data. Since licensing is often agent-based, this gets expensive.</p>

<p>Related to monitoring tools is the concept of an element manager. Element managers are low-level tools for managing various classes of digital or IT infrastructure. For example, Cisco provides software for managing network infrastructure, and EMC provides software for managing its storage arrays. Microsoft provides a variety of tools for managing various Windows components. Notice that such tools often play a dual role, in that they can both change the infrastructure configuration as well as report on its status. Many however are reliant on graphical user interfaces, which are falling out of favor as a basis for configuring infrastructure.</p>

<p>Monitoring tools, out of the box, can provide ongoing visibility to well understood aspects of the digital product: the performance of infrastructure, the capacity utilized, and well understood, common failure modes (such as a network link being down.) However, the digital product or application also needs to provide its own specific telemetry in various ways. This can be done through logging to output files, or in some cases through raising alerts via the network.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 73. Custom software requires custom monitoring</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A typical way to enable custom monitoring is to first use a standard logging library as part of the software development process. The logging library provides a consistent interface for the developer to create informational and error messages. Often, multiple "levels" of logging are seen, some more verbose than others. The monitoring tool is then configured to scan the logs for certain information. For example, if the application writes:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>APP-ERR-SEV1-946: Unresolvable database consistency issues detected, terminating application.</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>into the log, the monitoring tool can be configured to recognize the severity of the message and immediately raise an alert.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, as the quote at the beginning of this section suggests, it is critical that the monitoring discipline be based on continuous improvement. Keeping monitoring techniques current with your operational challenges is a never-ending task. Approaches that worked well yesterday, today generate too many false positives, and your operations team is now overloaded with all the noise. Ongoing questioning and improvement of your approaches is essential to keeping your monitoring system optimized for managing business impact as efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is not possible for a 24 x 7 operations team to access and understand the myriads of element managers and specialized monitoring tools present in the large IT environment. Instead, these teams rely on aggregators of various kinds to provide an integrated view into the complexity. These aggregators may focus on  status events, or specifically on performance aspects related either to the elements or to logical transactions flowing across them. They may incorporate dependencies from configuration management to provide a true “business view” into the event streams. This is directly analogous to the concept of <a href="#andon">Andon</a> board from Lean practices, or the idea of “information radiator” from Agile principles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A monitoring console may present a rich and detailed set of information to an operator. Too detailed, in fact, as systems become large. Raw event streams must be filtered for specific events or patterns of concern. Event de-duplication starts to become an essential capability, which leads to distinguishing the monitoring system from the event management system. Also, for this reason, monitoring tools are often linked directly to ticketing systems; on certain conditions, a <a href="#ticketing">ticket</a>
 (e.g. an <a href="#IT-process-emergence">Incident</a>) is created and assigned to a team or individual.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enabling a monitoring console to auto-create tickets however, needs to be carefully considered and designed. A notorious scenario is the “ticket storm,” where a monitoring system creates multiple (perhaps thousands) of tickets, all essentially in response to the same condition.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_understanding_business_impact">Understanding business impact</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the intersection of event aggregation and operations centers is the need to understand business impact. It is not, for example, always obvious what a server is being used for. This may be surprising to new students, and perhaps those with experience in smaller organizations. However, in many large “traditional” IT environments, where the operations team is distant from the development organization, it is not necessarily easy to determine what a given hardware or software resource is doing or why it is there. Clearly, this is unacceptable in terms of security, value management, and any number of other concerns. However, from the start of distributed computing, the question “what is on that server?” has been all too frequent in large IT shops.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The classic example of significant capacity utilization is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday_(shopping)">Black Friday/Cyber Monday</a> experience of retailers. Both physical store and online ecommerce systems are placed under great strain annually around this time, with the year&#8217;s profits potentially on the line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Performance management focuses on the responsiveness (e.g. speed) of the systems being used. Responsiveness may be related to capacity utilization, but some capacity issues don&#8217;t immediately affect responsiveness. For example, a disk drive may be approaching full. When it fills, the system will immediately crash, and performance is severely affected. But until then, the system performs fine. The disk needs to be replaced on the basis of capacity reporting, not performance trending. On the other hand, some performance issues are not related to capacity. A mis-configured router might badly affect a web site&#8217;s performance, but the configuration simply needs to be fixed - there is no need to handle as a capacity-related issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a simpler level, capacity and performance management may consist of monitoring CPU, memory, and storage utilization across a given set of nodes, and raising alerts if certain thresholds are approached. For example, if a critical server is frequently approaching 50% CPU utilization (leaving 50% "headroom"), engineers might identify that another server should be added. Abbot and Fisher suggest, "As a general rule of thumb, we like to start at 50% as the ideal usage percentage
and work up from there as the arguments dictate" <a href="#Abbott2015">[Abbott2015]</a>, p 204.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what do we do when a capacity alert is raised, either through an automated system or through the manual efforts of a capacity analyst? There are a number of responses that may follow:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Acquire more capacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seek to use existing capacity more efficiently</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throttle demand somehow</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Capacity analytics at its most advanced (i.e. across hundreds or thousands of servers and services) is a true Big Data problem domain, and starts to overlap with IT asset management, capital planning, and budgeting in significant ways. As your organization scales up and you find yourself responding more frequently to the kinds of operational issues described in this section, you might start asking yourself whether you can be more pro-active. What steps can you take when developing or enhancing your systems, so that operational issues are minimized? You want systems that are stable, easily upgraded, and that can scale quickly on demand. Fortunately, there is a rich body of experience on how to build such systems, which we will discuss in a subsequent section.</p>

<p>Monitoring communicates the state of the digital systems to the professionals in charge of them. Acting on that telemetry involves additional tools and practices, some of which we&#8217;ll review in this section.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_communication_channels">Communication channels</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When signals emerge from the lower levels of the digital infrastructure, they pass through a variety of layers and cause assorted, related behavior among the responsible digital professionals. The accompanying illustration shows a typical hierarchy, brought into action as an event becomes apparently more significant.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The digital components send events to the monitoring layer, which filters them for significant concerns, for example a <a href="#custom-monitoring">serious application failure</a>. The monitoring tool might automatically create a ticket, or perhaps it first provides an alert to the systems operators, who might instant message each other, or perhaps join a chat room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the issue can&#8217;t be resolved operationally before it starts impacting users, an <a href="#ops-day-in-life">Incident</a> ticket might be created, which has several effects:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>First, the situation is now a matter of record, and management may start to pay attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accountability for managing the Incident is defined, and expectations are that responsible parties will start to resolve it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If assistance is needed, the Incident provides a common point of reference (it is a common <a href="#representation">reference point</a>), in terms of <a href="#2.05.00-work-management">Work Management</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the seriousness of the Incident, further communications by IM, chat, cell phone, email, and/or conference bridge may continue. Severe incidents in regulated industries may require recording of conference bridges.</p>

<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">What is ChatOps?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ChatOps is the tight integration of instant communications with operational execution. As Eric Sigler of PagerDuty describes it, "<em>While in a chat room, team members type commands that the chat bot is configured to execute through custom scripts and plugins. These can range from code deployments to security event responses to team member notifications. The entire team collaborates in real-time as commands are executed</em>" <a href="#Sigler2014">[Sigler2014]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Properly configured ChatOps provides a low-friction collaborative environment, enabling a powerful and immediate collective mental model of the situation and what is being done. It also provides a rich audit trail of who did what, when, and who else was involved. Fundamental governance objectives of accountability can be considered fulfilled in this way, on par with paper or digital forms routed for approval (and without their corresponding delays).</p>

&#8230;&#8203;just designing a fault tolerant architecture is not enough. We have to constantly test our ability to actually survive these "once in a blue moon" failures.<br>
<br>
This was our philosophy when we built Chaos Monkey, a tool that randomly disables our production instances to make sure we can survive this common type of failure without any customer impact. The name comes from the idea of unleashing a wild monkey with a weapon in your data center (or cloud region) to randomly shoot down instances and chew through cables&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;all the while we continue serving our customers without interruption. By running Chaos Monkey in the middle of a business day, in a carefully monitored environment with engineers standing by to address any problems, we can still learn the lessons about the weaknesses of our system, and build automatic recovery mechanisms to deal with them.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted above, it is difficult to fully reproduce complex production infrastructures as "lower" environments. Therefore, it is difficult to have confidence in any given change until it has been run in production.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The need to emulate "real world" conditions is well understood in the military, which relies heavily on drill and exercises to ensure peak operational readiness. Analogous practices are emerging in digital organizations, such as the concept of "Game Days"&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;defined periods when operational disruptions are simulated and the responses assessed. A related set of tools is the Netflix Simian Army, a collection of resiliency tools developed by the online video-streaming service Netflix. It represents a significant advancement in digital risk management, as previous control approaches too often were limited by poor scalability or human failure (e.g. forgetfulness or negligence in following manual process steps).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Chaos Monkey is one of a number of tools developed to continually "harden" the Netflix system, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Latency Monkey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;introduces arbitrary network delays</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conformity Monkey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;checks for consistency with architectural standards, and shuts down non-conforming instances</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Doctor Monkey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;checks for longer-term evidence of instance degradation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Janitor Monkey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;checks for and destroys unused running capacity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security Monkey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;an extension of Conformity Monkey, checks for correct security configuration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10-18 Monkey&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;checks internationalization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, Chaos Gorilla simulates the outage of an entire Amazon availability zone</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the whole, the Simian Army behaves much as antibodies do in an organic system. One notable characteristic is that the monkeys as described do not generate a report (a <a href="#secondary-artifacts">secondary artifact</a>) for manual followup. They simply shut down the offending resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such direct action may not be possible in many environments, but represents an ideal to work toward. It keeps the security and risk work "front and center" within the mainstream of the digital pipeline, rather than relegating it to the bothersome "additional work" it can so easily be seen as.</p>

<h5 id="_post_mortems_blamelessness_and_operational_demand">Post-mortems, blamelessness, and operational demand</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We briefly mentioned <a href="#IT-process-emergence">Problem Management</a> as a common operational process. After an Incident is resolved and services are restored,</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have discussed <a href="#psych-safety">psychological safety</a> previously. Psychological safety takes on an additional and even more serious aspect when we consider major systems outages, many of which are caused by human error. There has been a long history of management seeking individuals to "hold accountable" when complex systems fail. This is an unfortunate approach, as complex systems are always prone to failure. Cultures that seek to blame do not promote a sense of psychological safety.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The definition of "counterfactual" is important. A "counterfactual" is seen in statements of the form, "If only Joe had not re-indexed the database, then the outage would not have happened." It may be true that if Joe had not done so, the outcome would have been different. But there might be other such counterfactuals. They are not helpful in developing a continual improvement response. The primary concern in assessing such a failure is, how was Joe put in a position to fail? Put differently, how is it that the system was designed to be vulnerable to such behavior on Joe&#8217;s part? How could it be designed differently, and in a less sensitive way?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is, in fact, how aviation has become so safe. Investigators with the unhappy job of examining large scale airplane crashes have developed a systematic, clinical, and rational approach for doing so. They learned that if the people they were questioning perceived a desire on their part to blame, the information they provided was less reliable. (This of course is obvious to any parent of a 4 year old.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>John Allspaw, CTO of Etsy, has pioneered the application of modern safety and incident investigation practices in digital contexts, and notably has been an evangelist for the work of human factors expert and psychologist Sidney Dekker. Dekker summarizes attitudes towards human error as falling into either the Old or New Views. He summarizes the old view as the Bad Apple theory:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Complex systems would be fine, were it not for the erratic behavior of some unreliable people (Bad Apples) in it</em>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Human errors cause accidents: humans are the dominant contributor to more than two thirds of them;</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Failures come as unpleasant surprises. They are unexpected and do not belong in the system. Failures are introduced to the system only through the inherent unreliability of people.</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dekker contrasts this with the New View:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Human error is not a cause of failure. Human error is the effect, or symptom, of deeper trouble.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Human error is not random. It is systematically connected to features of people&#8217;s tools, tasks and operating environment.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Human error is not the conclusion of an investigation. It is the starting point.</em> <a href="#Dekker2006">[Dekker2006]</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dekker&#8217;s principles are an excellent starting point for developing a culture that supports blameless investigations into incidents. We will talk more systematically of culture in Chapter 7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, once a post-mortem or Problem analysis has been conducted, what is to be done? If work is required to fix the situation (and when is it not?), this work will compete with other priorities in the organization. <a href="#the-product-team">Product teams</a> typically like to develop new features, not solve operational issues that may call for reworking existing features. Yet serving both forms of work is essential from an holistic, <a href="#design-thinking">design thinking</a> point of view.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of queuing, operational demand is too often subject to the equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation_(computer_science)">queue starvation</a> - which as Wikipedia notes is usually the result of "naive scheduling algorithms." If we always and only work on what we believe to be the "highest priority" problems, operational issues may never get attention. One result of this is the concept of <a href="#technical-debt">technical debt</a>, which we discuss in Part IV.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Designing complex systems that can scale effectively and be operated efficiently is a challenging topic. Many insights have been developed by the large-scale public-facing Internet sites, such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, and others. The recommended reading at the end of this chapter provides many references.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A reasonable person might question why systems <strong>design</strong> questions are appearing here in the chapter on operations. We have discussed certain essential factors for system scalability previously: <a href="#cloud">Cloud</a>, <a href="#infracode">infrastructure as code</a>, <a href="#version-control">version control</a>, and <a href="#continuous-delivery">continuous delivery</a>. These are all necessary, but not sufficient to scaling digital systems. Once a system starts to encounter real load, further attention must go to how it <strong>runs</strong>, as opposed to what it <strong>does</strong>. It&#8217;s not easy to know when to focus on scalability. If <a href="#prod-discovery-techniques">product discovery</a> is not on target, the system will never get the level of use that requires scalability. Insisting that the digital product have a state of the art scalable design might be wasteful, if the team is still searching for a <a href="#lean-startup">Minimum Viable Product</a> (in Lean Startup terms). Of course, if you are doing systems engineering and  <a href="#flower-and-cog">building a "cog," not growing a "flower,"</a> you may need to be thinking about these factors earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what often happens is that the system goes through various prototypes until something with market value is found, and at that point, as use starts to scale up, the team scrambles for a more robust approach. Chapter 2  <a href="#scale-matters">warned of this</a>, and mentioned the <a href="https://gist.github.com/jboner/2841832">Latency Numbers</a>; now would be a good time to review those.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are dozens of books and articles discussing many aspects of how to scale systems. In this section, we will discuss two important principles (the CAP Principle and the AKF Scaling Cube). If you are interested in this topic in depth, check out the references in this chapter.</p>

<div class="paragraph">

<div class="title">Figure 77. CAP principle</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scaling digital systems used to imply acquiring faster and more powerful hardware and software. If a 4-core server with 8 gigabytes of RAM isn&#8217;t enough, get a 32-core server with 256 gB of RAM (and upgrade your database software accordingly, for millions of dollars more). This kind of scaling is termed "vertical" scaling. However, web-scale companies such as Facebook and Google determined that this would not work indefinitely. Infinitely scaling vertically is not physically (or financially) possible. Instead, these companies began to experiment aggressively with using large numbers of inexpensive commodity computers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The advantage to scaling vertically is that all your data can reside on one server, with fast and reliable access. As soon as you start to split your data across servers, you run into the practical implications of the CAP principle.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CAP stands for:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Consistency</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Availability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partition-tolerance</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and the CAP Principle (or Theorem) states that it is not possible to build a distributed system that guarantees all three  <a href="#Fox1999">[Fox1999]</a>. What does this mean? First, let&#8217;s define our terms:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Consistency</strong> means that all the servers (or "nodes") in the system see the same data at the same time. If an update is being processed, no node will see it before any other. This is often termed a transactional guarantee, and it is the sort of processing relational databases excel at.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if you change your flight, and your seat opens up, a consistent reservation application will show the free seat simultaneously to anyone who inquires, even if the reservation information is replicated across two or more geographically distant nodes. If the seat is reserved, no node will show it available, even if it takes some time for the information to replicate across the nodes. The system will simply not show anyone any data until it can show everyone the correct data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Availability</strong> means what it implies: that the system is available to provide data on request. If we have many nodes with the same data on them, this can improve availability, since if one is down, the user can still reach others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Partition-tolerance</strong> is the ability of the distributed system to handle communications outages. If we have two nodes, both expected to have the same data, and the network stops communicating between them, they will not be able to send updates to each other. In that case, there are two choices: either stop providing services to all users of the system (failure of availability) or accept that the data may not be the same across the nodes (failure of consistency).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the earlier years of computing, the preference was for strong consistency and vendors such as Oracle profited greatly by building database software that could guarantee it, when properly configured. Such systems could be consistent and available, but could not tolerate network outages - if the network was down, the system, or at least a portion of it, would also be down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Companies such as Google and Facebook took the alternative approach. They said, "We will accept inconsistency in the data so that our systems are always available." Clearly, for a social media site such as Facebook, a posting does not need to be everywhere at once before it can be shown at all. To verify this, simply post to a social media site using your computer. Do you see the post on your phone, or your friend&#8217;s, as soon as you submit it on your computer? No, although it is fast, you can see some delay. This shows that the site is not strictly consistent; a strictly consistent system would always show  the same data across all the accessing devices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The challenge with accepting inconsistency is how to do so. Eventually, the system needs to become consistent, and if conflicting updates are made they need to be resolved. Scalable systems in general favor availability and partition-tolerance as principles, and therefore must take explicit steps to restore consistency when it fails. The approach taken to partitioning the system into replicas is critical to managing eventual consistency, which brings us to the AKF scaling cube.</p>

<p>Another powerful tool for thinking about scaling systems is the AKF Scaling Cube. AKF stands for Abbott, Keeven, and Fisher, authors of <em>The Art of Scalability</em> <a href="#Abbott2015">[Abbott2015]</a>. The AKF cube is a visual representation of the three basic options for scaling a system:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Replicate the complete system (x-axis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split the system functionally into smaller layers or components (y-axis)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>complete system replica</strong> is similar to the Point of Sale terminals in a retailer. Each is a self-contained system with all the data it needs to handle typical transactions. POS terminals do not depend on each other and therefore you can keep increasing the capacity of your store&#8217;s checkout lines by simply adding more fo them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Functional splitting</strong> is when you separate out different <a href="#feature-v-component">features or components</a>. To continue the retail analogy, this is like a department store; you view and buy electronics, or clothes, in those specific departments. The store "scales" by adding departments, which are self-contained in general; however, in order to get a complete outfit, you may need to visit several. In terms of systems, separating web and database servers is commonly seen - this is a component separation. E-commerce sites often separate "show" (product search and display) from "buy" (shopping cart and online checkout); this is a feature separation. Complex distributed systems may have large numbers of features and components, all orchestrated together into one common web or smartphone app experience.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Data splitting</strong> is the concept of "partitioning" from the CAP discussion, above. Have you ever checked into a large event, and the first thing you see is check-in stations divided by alphabet range? For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A-H register here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I-Q register here</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>R-Z register here</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a good example of splitting by data. In terms of digital systems, we might split data by region; customers in Minnesota might go to the Kansas City data center, while customers in New Jersey might go to a North Carolina data center. Obviously, the system needs to handle situations where people are traveling or move.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many ways to implement and combine the 3 axes of the AKF scaling cube to meet the CAP constraints (consistency, availability, and partition-tolerance). With further study of scalability, you will encounter discussions of:</p>

The following are examples of state:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name of a particular server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network address of that server</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The software installed on that server, in terms of the exact version and bits that comprise it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>State also has more transient connotations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The current processes listed in the process table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The memory allocated to each process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current users logged into the system</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we saw in the previous section some server/application/business mappings. These are also a form of state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore not possible to make blanket statements like “we need to manage state.” Computing devices go through myriads of state changes with every cycle of their internal clock. (Analog and quantum computing are out of scope for this book.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The primary question in managing state is “what matters”? What aspects of the system need to persist, in a reliable and reproducible manner? <a href="#policy-config">Policy-aware</a> tools are used extensively to ensure that the system maintains its configuration, and that new functionality is constructed (to the greatest degree possible) using consistent configurations throughout the digital pipeline.</p>

“Don’t mess with that server! It’s … Production!!!”

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Production” is a term that new IT recruits rapidly learn has forbidding connotations. To be “in production” means that the broader enterprise value stream is directly dependent on that asset. Breakage or mishandling will result in questions and concerns from powerful forces. Be Very Scared.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do things get to be “in production”? What do we mean by that?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let’s get back to our fundamental principle that there is an IT system delivering some "moment of truth" to someone. This system can be of any scale, but as above we are able to conceive of it having a <a href="#state-config-discovery">“state.”</a> When we want to change the behavior of this system, we are cautious. We reproduce the system at varying levels of fidelity (building "lower" environments with <a href="#infracode">Infrastructure as Code</a> techniques) and experiment with potential state changes. This is called development. When we start to gain confidence in our experiments, we increase the fidelity and also start to communicate more widely that we are contemplating a change to the state of the system. We may increase the fidelity along a set of traditional names:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Development</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QA</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Performance Testing</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final state, where value is realized, is “Production.” Moving functionality in smaller and smaller batches, with increasing degrees of automation, is called <a href="#continuous-delivery">continuous delivery</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/2.06-environments.png" alt="environments" width="720">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is nothing sacred about the environments listed above. You will see many variations, especially at scale.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea that one sequentially moves (”promotes”) new system functionality through a series of states to gain confidence before finally changing the state of the production system is historically well established. However, the production state is notoriously difficult to reproduce fully, especially in highly distributed environments. While infrastructure as code has simplified the problem, lower environments simply can&#8217;t match production completely in all its complexity, especially interfaced interactions with other systems or when large, expensive pools of capacity are involved. Therefore <strong>there is always risk in changing the state of the production system.</strong> Mitigating strategies include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extensive automated test harnesses that can quickly determine if system behavior has been unfavorably altered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensuring that changes to the production system can be easily and automatically reversed. For example, code may be deployed but not enabled until a "feature toggle" is set. This allows quick shutdown of that code if issues are seen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increasing the fidelity of lower environments with strategies such as service virtualization to make them behave more like production.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardening services against their own failure in production, or the failure of services on which they depend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reducing the size (and therefore complexity and risk) of changes to production (a key DevOps strategy). Variations here include:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small functional changes ("one line of code")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Small operational changes (deploying a change to just one node out of 100, and watching it, before deploying to the other 99 nodes.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using policy-aware infrastructure management tools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another important development in environmental approaches is A/B testing. In this approach, the “production” environment is segregated into two or more discrete states, with different features or behaviors exposed to users in order to assess their reactions. Netflix uses this as a key tool for <a href="#prod-discovery-techniques">product discovery</a>, testing the user reaction to different user interface techniques for example.</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="title">Do we need environments at all?</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have heard it recommended that the term “environment” be eliminated, as it tends to result in turf wars and empire building, and potentially the waste of fixed assets. Performance environments (that can emulate production at scale) are particularly in question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead, in a dynamic infrastructure environment (private or public), one simply defines the kind of test one wants to perform and provisions that capacity on-demand.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__development_is_production">“Development is production”</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It used to be that the concept of “testing in production” was frowned upon. Now, with these mitigating strategies, and the recognition that complex systems cannot ever be fully reproduced, there is more tolerance for the idea. But with older systems that may lack automated testing, incremental deployment, or easy rollback, it is strongly recommended to retain existing promotion strategies, as these are battle-tested and known to reduce risk. Often, their cycle time can be decreased.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the flip side, development systems must never be treated casually.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="#pipeline">development pipeline</a> itself represents a significant operational commitment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure of a source code repository, if not backed up, could wipe out a company (see <a href="#Marks2014">[Marks2014]</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The failure of a build server or package repository could be almost as bad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the digital economy, dozens or hundreds of developers out of work represents a severe operational and financial setback, even if the “production” systems continue to function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s therefore important to treat “development” platforms with the same care as production systems. This requires nuanced approaches: with infrastructure as code, particular virtual machines or containers may represent experiments, expected to fail often and be quickly rebuilt. No need for burdensome change processes when virtual machine base images and containers are being set up and torn down hundreds of times each day! However, the platforms supporting the instantiation and teardown of those VMs are production platforms, supporting the business of new systems development.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Site reliability engineering is a new term for operations-centric work, originating from Google and other large digital organizations. It is clearly an operational discipline; the SRE team is responsible for the "availability, latency, performance, efficiency, change management, monitoring, emergency response, and capacity planning of their service" <a href="#Beyer2016">[Beyer2016]</a>, p.7.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google site reliability engineers have strong technical backgrounds, frequently computer science, which is atypical for operations staff in the traditional IT industry. SREs are strongly incented to automate as much as possible, avoiding "toil" (i.e., repetitive, non-value-add tasks.) In other words, as Benjamin Sloss says, "we want systems that are automatic, not just automated" <a href="#Beyer2016">[Beyer2016]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google has pioneered a number of innovative practices with its SRE team, including:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>a 50% cap on aggregate "ops" work - the other 50% is supposed to be spent on development</p>

<p>While operations management is an integral part of "DevOps," and of a given product&#8217;s management, it is still a distinct area of concern and practice.

<pre>Notes on second half of book... as of 2016, this is where the conflict between Agile/Lean IT and the old ways becomes more pronounced ... the first half of the book represents the new industry consensus, but as we seek to scale it up, everywhere one looks one sees unquestioned acceptance of Taylorist approaches unsuited to Lean product management in a services organization ...</pre>

<p><strong>Scenario</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are now a "team of teams," at a size where face to face communication is increasingly supplemented by other forms of communication and coordination. You are seeing more and more specialization in your organization, with the tendency of functional specialists to identify more with their field than with the needs of your customers and your business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your teams are all good, and get results, but in different ways. You need some level of coordination and not everyone can talk to everyone; people are no longer co-located and there may be different schedules involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You now have multiple products. As you moved from your first product to adding more, significant organizational evolution was required. Your products may also be developing complex interdependencies. Tensions between various teams are starting to emerge. There is an increasing desire among your stakeholders and executives for control and predictability. Resources are limited and always in contention. You are considering various frameworks for managing your organization. This is where it gets hard.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New employees are bringing in their experiences, and the more experienced ones seem to assume that the company will use "projects" and "processes" to get work done. There are no shortage of contractors and consultants all advocating various flavors of process and project management, some advocating older approaches and "frameworks" and others proposing newer Agile &amp; Lean perspectives. However, the very concepts of process and project management are occasionally called into question by both your employees and various "thought leaders," and it&#8217;s all very confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need to understand where these ideas came from, how they relate to each other, and how they are evolving in a digitally transforming world.</p>

<p>Scenario:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 7: Culture and Organization</strong>
 We&#8217;re getting big.  How are we formally structured? How are people grouped, and to whom do they report, with what kind of expectations? Why this way and not that? Who are we? What are the unspoken assumptions that underly our daily work?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 8: Project and Resource Management</strong>
You want to get bigger stuff done. Some argue that you don&#8217;t need projects at all any more, that it&#8217;s all about <strong>products</strong>, not <strong>projects</strong>. But you&#8217;ve seen that your most ambitious ideas require orchestration. And when resources are tight (and when aren&#8217;t they?) their consumption must be governed somehow. Financial management has always been a concern, but it needs increasing formalization as your activities diversify.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, do we have the right people doing the the work? How can we find the best people to grow our initiative? We also remain concerned that work continues to flow well, that we don&#8217;t take on too much work in process, and that people are not overloaded and multi-tasking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Chapter 9: Process Management</strong>
OK, we have a structure.  Work needs to flow across the structure, and the projects and products need certain resources and services delivered predictably. Our increasingly specialized organization needs some specialization of processes, and without some kind of coordination our risks increase along with our complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Process management, like project management, is a discipline unto itself and one of the most powerful tools in your toolbox. You start to realize there is a process by which  process itself is managed - the process of continuous improvement.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are going through a critical phase, the "team of teams" transition. You have increasingly specialized people delivering an increasingly complex product, or perhaps even several distinct products. Deep-skilled employees are great, but you&#8217;ve noticed they tend to lose the big picture. You are in constant discussions around the tension between functional depth versus product delivery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You often think about how your company should be structured. There is no shortage of opinions there either. From functional centers of excellence to cross-functional product teams, and from strictly hierarchical models to radical models like holacracy, there seems to be an infinite variety of choices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of your employees and consultants emphasize the role of culture, but what do they mean? Is there such a thing as a "good" culture? How is one culture better than another? How can you retain that startup feel you had previously, with things getting this big?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, as you move into leadership, you realize that your concern for organization and culture is all about creating the conditions for success. You can&#8217;t drive success as an individual any more; that is increasingly for others to do. All you can do is set the stage for their efforts, provide overall direction and vision, and let your teams do what they do best.</p>

In the early stages, you have to hire generalists who are both willing and able to take on dozens of tasks at once. Your developers will have to speak with potential customers; your accountants will have to give advice on product direction; and the born salesman on your team will need to put the phone down a few hours a day and set up a new employee’s computer. This is the exciting, four-people-and-an-idea stage popularly associated with startups— but it doesn’t last very long.<br>

For a lot of your employees, growing out of this phase will be a welcome development: programmers don’t want to be in accounting meetings, and salespeople don’t want to sit in a dark, quiet room with the engineers. People have talents and skills they want to develop, and a healthy degree of specialization allows them to do that.

<p>So, you are getting bigger now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even as a cohesive, single team you had increasing complexity of support services. You needed legal and accounting advice to get the startup going. When you started hiring people, you needed HR and payroll. You also are buying things and paying bills, and you’ve got sales people and marketing people and you need to support your customers and collect money they have promised to pay. At some point you need an internal person whose daily job is money (they’ll become the CFO someday).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How are you going to organize? More importantly, how are you going to think about organizing? This is a hard question. It’s important to get organization right, and the question never goes away. There is a lot of theory, history, and advice available on to how to organize your company.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not a general business school textbook, or even  a textbook on startups and entrepreneurship. However, in the current environment, it is essential for the digital professional, no matter how specialized, to understand the general context they are operating in. In one chapter, we cannot cover much, but there’s an increasing consensus that the choice of organizational form has a fundamental impact on the success of IT-based product delivery.</p>

<p>In keeping with our <a href="#0.01-emergence">evolutionary approach</a>, let’s assume you’ve been fairly ad-hoc in your organizational structure up to now, doing your best to avoid specialization.

<p>Perhaps the first question you need to ask is to what extent you wish to centralize your digital organization. This is a significant one. The current trend is towards decentralizing IT, but there are good reasons to maintain IT as a separate organizational entity. Sriram Narayan, in his book <em>Agile Organization Design</em> (<a href="#Narayam2015">[Narayam2015]</a>), points out that "IT work is labor-intensive and highly specialized," and therefore sourcing IT talent is a particular organizational capability it may not make sense to distribute. Furthermore, he observes that IT work is performed on medium to long time scales, and  "IT culture" differs from "business culture." (The last may be debatable in the long run, in the digitally transforming world.)</p>

<p><strong>Centralized versus decentralized IT</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What do we mean by "centralized" versus "decentralized," anyways? There are many models for structuring IT, but at one end of the spectrum is when everyone doing anything significant with configuring computers, developing software, or supporting IT networking reports up through a powerful Chief Information Officer, who may report to the CEO, COO, CFO, or other senior executive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, in a "decentralized" model, computing is procured and managed by diverse managers in other functional units. So, the Human Resource VP might have an IT manager, the Marketing director would have one, and so on. The IT managers might know each other but they report to different managers and may have a very limited ability to share resources and learnings.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted at the  <a href="#1.01.02-IT-as-function-2">outset</a>, IT has certain unchanging aspects regardless of whether is a separate or embedded organization. However, the purpose of this chapter is to help you think carefully about this very question.</p>

<p>Let’s assume you are going to break the product into two feature teams. One will focus on the existing market and the other will develop a new major feature for a new, distinct set of user value propositions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do this, you are going to bring in a new UX specialist, a new Java programmer, a new sales person, and someone to field customer support calls. Lena also intends to step back a bit from direct product ownership, so a new Chief Marketing Officer comes in. She talks with an organizational consultant who proposed the following new structure:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may seem reasonable. Everyone agreed that there is no need to add more people to help Sonya and Andre; they can support both feature teams. Obviously, the new sales person comes in under Tomas.
Because Peter was the one receiving all the calls, and in the interest of giving him a clear career path, it was determined that the first product support person would come in under him, in what was anticipated to become a dedicated help desk/call center.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was perceived that the engineering team would likely be receiving various requests and so a dotted line appears on the organization chart, indicating a service relationship. The new support person under Peter would also be shared across both teams, and there needed to be some means of communicating support requests to the feature teams when their support was needed. There was some question as to how the office Kanban boards might be reconfigured to support these relationships. Peter and Sonya, after some online research, started to become interested in something called ITIL (the IT Infrastructure Library), which prescribed multiple IT processes that could be used as a basis for organizing.</p>

<p>But before that discussion continued, Lena retained another consultant as a cross-check. This consultant had worked with many Silicon Valley startups and had a very different opinion. This consultant was inspired by the <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1018963/Articles/SpotifyScaling.pdf">“Spotify model”</a> and proposed the following scaled-down version of it:</p>

<p><strong>Sidebar: Dunbar and Spotify</strong>
Managing organizational growth is a well studied problem. Military examples are often seen, as military organizations have devoted much resource to understanding organizational dynamics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is much research into how human beings organize into groups of various sizes. Perhaps the best known is that of Robin Dunbar, who has theorized that human beings (as evolved primates) can “only comfortably maintain 150 stable relationships.” (per <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number">Wikipedia</a>)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Dunbar has researched this projection across the anthropological data, finding that human groups tend to fall into size ranges of</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>30-50 (bands)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>100-200 (clans)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Online music vendor Spotify has adopted insights from Dunbar as it scales.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The consultant also added something called “guilds” to the model:</p>

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.07-with-guilds.png" alt="3.07 with guilds">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “guilds” are not formal reporting mechanisms, but rather a way for people doing similar work to share experiences, best practices, and so forth. Each tribe has a designated lead:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tomas leads the Sales guild</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mohammed leads the UX guild</p>

<li>
<p>TBD leads the support guild</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea would be that the guilds would meet regularly (perhaps bi-weekly) and would have their own forums on the company’s social media channels. The head of each guild would meet with Lena monthly to discuss issues and concerns, and would have a direct channel of communication to her as needed for more time sensitive matters.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>One fact everyone agreed on was that Sonya had to do more Linux and Andre has to learn some NoSQL and other platform technology. But this fact was not put into the matrix as there was not agreement as to whether this was a pro or a con. On one hand, it did seem a bit wasteful, but it was also recognized as a good thing in terms of cross training and deepening the bench. Sonya also felt that a Data guild would eventually be needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everyone agreed that the engineering guild in particular would need to be a very strong guild, to ensure consistency of approaches around key disciplines like source control, security, platform choices, build pipeline, and so forth. The other guilds could be a bit lighter weight, but the engineering guild leader could set binding technical policies across the product teams if need be (the expectation was that this would not be done lightly).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It was recognized that eventually a distinct operations &amp; engineering team might still be necessary, but probably not until another round of scaling, and that that team, per the Spotify model, would be more focused on setting up self-service tools for the product teams, and would avoid ticketed work as much as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another “neither pro nor con” but important was that the second option eliminated the new VP layer. Establishing an executive layer might still happen later, the consultant suggested, but it was premature to do so now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After further discussion and benchmarking with other startups, the second option was chosen. The new support person for Feature Team 2 would be able to be hired without urgency, allowing time for a high quality search.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As mentioned at the outset of this chapter, there is much research and thought available on the question of how to organize an enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One useful model for understanding the problems of organizational structure is the Five Forces model of Henry Mintzberg  <a href="#Mintzberg1983">[Mintzberg1983]</a>. While much organization theory (even recent work) is presented as a simple, sequential model, the Mintzberg approach is more sophisticated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In simple, sequential models, organizations are presented as evolving from less good to more good types. Such models might propose a simplistic, bad-better-best sequence such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 1 Simple, authoritarian and fear-based</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 2 Strictly hierarchical and complex</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 3 Divisionally decentralized</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 4 Matrixed and process-driven</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Type 5 Evolutionary/next-generation</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(The above sequence is a synthesis of various industry sources which are deliberately left unidentified, to protect the guilty.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, Mintzberg points out that different industry sectors and business types result in different kinds of organizational forms, and that certain tendencies (“pulls”) are evident which are not in and of themselves either good or bad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Factors like line/staff interactions and lateral linkages also complicate the picture.
After extensive review and summarization of peer-reviewed research, Mintzberg developed the following models of corporate structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, the question of structure is at an equivalent level with various other internal concerns:</p>

<p>By this time, you probably detect that there is a fundamental tension between functional specialization and end to end value delivery. This tension is the topic of endless research, articles, books, and commentary in the mainstream business press and more specialized channels. The tension may go by different names:</p>

<p>Flow vs resource</p>

<p>The above slide is worth a careful examination. The idea is that the more effective you are at product flow, the further to the right you are. The more efficient you are with your resources, the further up you are. It is easy to be completely efficient with resources, and have no flow. It is also possible to be very good at flow, but at the cost of little resource efficiency. Being excellent at both, however, is impossible - there is an outer boundary.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, there is an interesting dynamic if you seek too much resource efficiency. Loading staff more and more heavily has counterproductive results, in which flow actually decreases, and the resulting "coordination chaos" also decreases resource efficiency in a vicious reinforcing feedback loop.</p>

<p>There is a spectrum of alternatives in structuring organizations for flow across functional concerns. First, a lightweight project structure may be implemented, in which the project manager has limited power to influence the activity-based work, where people sit, etc. The project manager is little more than a factory floor expediter in this model.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Work flows across the functions, perhaps called "centers of excellence," and there may be contention for resources within each center. Often, simple "first in, first out" approaches are used to manage the work, rather than more sophisticated approaches such as Cost of Delay. We will focus in Chapter 9 on approaches to mitigate these issues while retaining this overall organizational form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, a heavyweight project structure may specify much more, including modes of work, standards, etc. The functional manager may be little more than a resource manager, but does still have reporting authority over the team member and crucially still writes their annual performance evaluation (if the organization still uses those.)</p>

<p>"Culture" is a difficult term to define, and even more difficult to characterize across large organizations. It starts with how an organization is formally structured, as structure is in part a set of expectations around how information flows. "Who talks to who, when and why" is in a sense culture. Culture can also be seen embedded in artifacts like processes and formally specified operating models. Certainly, much in the previous section on organizational theory implied culture; Mintzberg&#8217;s Five Forces all come with their own cultural tendencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But "culture" has additional, less tangible meanings. The anecdotes executives choose to repeat are culture. Whether an organization tacitly condones being 5 minutes late for meetings (because walk time in large facilities is expected) or has little tolerance for this (because most people dial in) is culture. The degree of deference shown to senior executives, and their opinions, is culture. Whether a junior person dares to hit "reply-all" on an email including her boss&#8217;s boss is culture.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Culture cannot be directly changed - it is better seen as a lagging indicator, that changes in response to specific practical interventions. Even tools and processes can change culture, if they are judiciously chosen (and most tools and processes do <strong>not</strong> have this effect). Skeptical? Consider the impact that computers - a tool - have had on culture. Or email.</p>

<p>One of the most important reasons to be concerned for culture is its effect on motivation. There is little doubt that a more motivated team performs better than an unmotivated, "going through the motions" organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, it is an article of faith in the Agile and Lean communities that motivated teams are more likely to collaborate effectively and seek creative, novel solutions to problems. (I am not sure if there is  evidence to this effect, but it seems intuitively obvious.)</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what motivates people?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the oldest discussions of culture is Douglas McGregor&#8217;s idea of <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Theory X</a> organizations, which he developed in the 1960s at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Theory X" organizations rely on extrinsic motivators and operate on the assumption that workers must be cajoled and punished in order to produce results. We see Theory X approaches when organizations focus on pay scales, bonuses, titles, awards, writeups/demerits, performance appraisals, and the like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Theory Y organizations operate on the assumption that most people seek meaningful work intrinsically and that they have the ability to solve problems in creative ways that do not require tight standardization. According to Theory Y, people can be trusted and should be treated as mature individuals, in contrast to the distrust inherent in Theory X.</p>

<p>This is not a neutral matrix. It&#8217;s not clear that highly controlling cultures are ever truly effective. Even in the military, which is generally assumed to be the ultimate "command and control" culture, there are notable case studies of increased performance when more empowering approaches were encouraged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, in <em>Turn the Ship Around: A True Story of Turning Followers Into Leaders</em>, Captain L. David Marquette discusses moving from a command-driven to an outcome-driven model and the beneficial results it had on the <em>USS Santa Fe</em>. Similar themes appear in Captain D. Michael Abrashoff&#8217;s <em>It&#8217;s Your Ship: Management Techniques from the Best Damn Ship in the Navy</em>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Neither of these accounts is surprising, when one considers the more sophisticated aspects of military doctrine. Don Reinertsen provides a rigorous overview in chapter 9 of <em>Principles of Product Development Flow</em>. In this discussion, he notes that the military has been experimenting with centralized vs. decentralized control for centuries. Modern warfighting relies on autonomous, self-directed teams that may be out of touch with central command and required to improvise effectively to achieve the mission.  Therefore, military orders are incomplete without a statement of "commander&#8217;s intent" - the ultimate outcome of the mission. <a href="#Reinertsen2009">[Reinertsen2009]</a>, pp. 243-265.</p>

<p>Academics and consultants have been studying Toyota for many years. The performance and influence of the Japanese automaker is legendary, but it has been difficult to understand why.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much has been written about Toyota&#8217;s use of particular tools, such as kanban bins and andon boards. However, Toyota views these as ephemeral adaptations to the demands of its business.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>According to Mike Rother in <em>Toyota Kata</em>,  underlying Toyota&#8217;s particular tools and techniques are two powerful practices:</p>

<p>What is a <em>kata</em>? It is a Japanese word stemming from the martial arts, meaning pattern, routine, or drill. More deeply, it means "a way of keeping two things in alignment with each other."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The improvement kata is the repeated process by which Toyota managers investigate and resolve problems, in a hands-on, fact-based, and preconception-free manner, and improve processes towards a "target operating condition."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coaching kata is how the improvement kata is instilled in new generations of Toyota managers.</p>

<p>As Rother describes it, the coaching and improvement katas establish and reinforce a coherent culture or mental model of how goals are achieved and problems approached. It is understood that human judgement is not accurate or impartial. The method compensates with a teaching-by-example focus on seeking facts without preconceived notions, through direct, hands-on investigation and experimental approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not something that can be formalized into a simple checklist or process; it requires many guided examples and applications before the approach becomes ingrained in the upcoming manager.</p>

<blockquote>
hiring is one of the most important things a software organization does. Every good hire accelerates your organization; every poor hire is a drag on your organization.
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Sean Landis<br>
<cite>Agile Hiring</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a typical hiring process:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Solicit candidates, through various channels such as job boards and recruiters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review resumes and narrow candidate pool down for phone interviews</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Make offer, negotiate to acceptance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hire and onboard</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your organization has been hiring people for some time now. It&#8217;s always been one of your most important decisions, but you have reached the point where a more formal and explicit understanding of how you do this is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, why do you hire new staff? How and when do you perceive a need? It is well established that increasing the size of a team can slow it down. Legendary software engineer Fred Brooks, in his work <em>The Mythical Man Month</em>, identified the pattern that "adding more people to a late project makes it later" <a href="#Brooks1995">[Brooks1995]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Are you adding people because of a perceived need for specialist skills? While this will always be a reason for new hires, many argue in favor of "T-shaped" people - people who are deep in one skill, and broad in others. Hiring new staff has an impact on culture - is it better to train from within, or source externally?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, how are you hiring staff? In a traditional, functionally specialized model, someone in a Human Resources organization acts as an intermediary between the hiring manager, and the job applicant (sometimes with a recruiter also in the mix between the company and the applicant). Detailed job descriptions are developed, and applicants not explicitly matching the selection criteria (e.g. in their resume) are not invited for an interview.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Such practices do not necessarily result in good outcomes. Applicants routinely tailor resumes to the job description. In some cases they have been known to copy the job description into invisible sections of their resume, so that they are guaranteed a "match" if automated resume-scanning software is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A compelling case study of the limitations of traditional HR-driven hiring is discussed by Robert Sutton and Huggy Rao in <em>Scaling up Excellence : Getting to More without Settling for Less</em><a href="#Sutton2014">[Sutton2014]</a>. The authors describe the company Lotus Software, one of the pioneers of early desktop computing.</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With [company founder] Kapor’s permission, [head of organizational development] Klein pulled together the résumés of the first forty Lotus employees&#8230;&#8203;[and] submitted all forty résumés to the Lotus human resources department. Not one of the forty applicants, including Kapor, was invited for a job interview. The founders had built a world that rejected people like them.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sean Landis, author of <em>Agile Hiring</em> <a href="#Landis2011">[Landis2011]</a>, believes that</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"accepted hiring wisdom is not very effective when applied to software professionals." He further states that:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>very few companies hire well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>individuals with deep domain knowledge are in the best position to perform great hiring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>companies often focus on the wrong candidates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is important to track metrics on the cost and effectiveness of hiring practices</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, hiring is one of the most important decisions the digital enterprise makes, and it cannot be reduced to a simple process to be executed mechanically.
Requiring senior technical talent to interview candidates may result in improved hiring decisions. However, such requirements add to the overall demand on these individuals.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_allocation_and_tracking_people_s_time">Allocation and tracking people&#8217;s time</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a new hire enters your organization, they enter a complex system that will structure and direct their daily activities through a myriad of means. The various means that direct their action include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Team assignment (e.g. to an ongoing product)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project assignment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Process responsibilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice again the appearance of the <a href="#2.04.01-process-project-product">"3 Ps."</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product, project, and process become challenging when they are all allowed to generate demand on individuals independently of each other. In the worst case scenario, the <strong>same</strong> individual winds up with:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Collaborative team responsibilities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Fractional" allocation to one or more projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ticketed process responsibilities</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
Fractional allocation is the practice of funding individuals through assigning them at some % to a project. For example, a server engineer might be allocated 25% time to a project for 6 months to define its infrastructure architecture, while being assigned 30% to another project to refresh obsolete infrastructure.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When demand is un-coordinated, these multiple channels can result in multi-tasking and dramatic overburden, and in the worst case the individual becomes the constraint to enterprise value. Project managers expect deliverables on time, and have no visibility to operational concerns (e.g. outages) that may affect the ability of staff to deliver. Ad-hoc requests "smaller than a project, bigger than a ticket" further complicate matters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>Phoenix Project</em> presents an effective and realistic dramatization of the resulting challenges. Work is entering the system through multiple channels and the overburden on key individuals (such as Brent, the lead systems engineer) has reached crisis proportions. Through a variety of mechanisms, they take control of the demand channels and greatly improve the organization&#8217;s success. One of the most important lessons is well articulated by Erik, the mentor:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Your job as VP of IT Operations is to ensure the fast, predictable, and uninterrupted flow of planned work that delivers value to the business while minimizing the impact and disruption of unplanned work, so you can provide stable, predictable, and secure IT service&#8230;&#8203;You must figure out how to control the release of work into IT Operations and, more importantly, ensure that your most constrained resources are doing only the work that serves the goal of the entire system, not just one silo. <a href="#Kim2013">[Kim2013]</a>, p.91</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to understand the work, measuring the consumption of people&#8217;s time is important. There are various time tracking approaches:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simple allocation of staff payroll to product or organizational line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management systems (sometimes these are used for weekly time tracking, even for staff that are not assigned to projects - in such cases, placeholder operational projects are created)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Human Resource Management systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ticketing/workflow systems - advanced systems, such as those found in the Professional Services Automation sector, track time when tickets are in an "open" status.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backlog management systems (that may seem similar to ticketing systems)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Home built systems</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is little industry consensus on best practices here. There are reasonable concerns about the burden of time tracking on employees, and poor data quality resulting from employees attempting to "code" activities when summarizing their time on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.</p>

<p>Regardless of whether the company is a modern digital enterprise or more traditional in its approach, the commitment, performance, and results of employees is a critical concern. The traditional approach to managing this has been an annual review cycle, resulting in a performance ranking from 1-5:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Did not meet expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Partially met expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Met expectations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exceeded expectation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Significantly exceeded expectations</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This annual rating determines the employee&#8217;s compensation and career prospects in the organization. Some companies (notably GE and Microsoft) have attempted "stack rankings" in which the "bottom" performers must be terminated. High profile practitioners however are moving away from this practice <a href="#Brustein2013">[Brustein2013]</a>, <a href="#Olson2013">[Olson2013]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The traditional annual review is a large "batch" of <a href="#2.00.01-feedback">feedback</a> to the employee, and therefore ineffective in terms of systems theory, not much better than an <a href="#2.00.1-open-loop">open-loop</a> approach. Because of the weaknesses of such slow feedback (not to mention the large annual costs, expensive infrastructure, and opportunity costs of the time spent), companies are experimenting with other approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deloitte Consulting, as reported in the Harvard Business Review <a href="#Buckingham2015">[Buckingham2015]</a>, realized that its annual performance review process was consuming two million hours of time annually, and yet was not delivering the needed value. In particular, ratings were suffering from the measurable flaw that they tended to reveal more about the person <strong>doing</strong> the rating, than the person being rated!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They started by redefining the goals of the performance management system: to accurately identify and reward performance, and fuel its further improvements.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A new approach with greater statistical validity was implemented, based on four key questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given what I know of this person’s
performance, and if it were my money, I
would award this person the highest possible
compensation increase and bonus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Given what I know of this person’s
performance, I would always want him or her
on my team</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This person is at risk for low performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This person is ready for promotion today</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of the frequency of performance check-ins, they note:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Research into the practices of the best team leaders reveals that they conduct regular check-ins with each team member about near term work . . . to set expectations for the upcoming week, review priorities, comment on recent work, and provide course correction, coaching, or important new information . . .</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\. . . If a leader checks in less often than once a week, the team member’s priorities may become vague . . . the conversation will shift from coaching for near term  work to giving feedback about past performance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\. . . If you want people to talk about how to do their best work in the near future, they need to talk often. And so far we have found in our testing a direct and measurable correlation between the frequency of these conversations and the engagement of team members . . .</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sutton and Rao, in <em>Scaling up Excellence</em>, discuss the similar case of Adobe. At Adobe, "annual reviews required 80,000 hours of time from the 2,000 managers at Adobe each year, the equivalent of 40 full-time employees. After all that effort, internal surveys revealed that employees felt less inspired and motivated afterwards— and turnover increased."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of such costs and poor results, Adobe scrapped the entire performance management system in favor of a "check-in" approach. In this approach, managers are expected to have regular conversations about performance with employees, and are given much more say in salaries and merit increases. The managers themselves are evaluated through random "pulse surveys" that measure how well each manager "sets expectations, gives and receives feedback, and helps people with their growth and development." <a href="#Sutton2014">[Sutton2014]</a>, p. 113.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether incentives (e.g. pay raises) should be awarded individually or on a team basis is an ongoing topic of discussion in the industry. Results often derive from team performance, and the contributions of any one individual can be difficult to identify. Because of this, Scrum pioneer Ken Schwaber argues that "The majority of the enterprise&#8217;s bonus and incentive funds need to be allocated based on the team&#8217;s performance rather than the individual&#8217;s performance." <a href="#Schwaber2007">[Schwaber2007]</a>, p.6.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this runs into another problem: that of the "free-rider." What do we do about team members who do not pull their weight? Even in self-organizing teams, confronting someone about their behavior is not something people do willingly, or well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally, teams will self-police, but this becomes less effective with scale. In one case study in the Harvard Business Review, Continental Airlines found that the free rider problem was less of a concern when metrics were clearly correlated with team activity. In their case, the efforts and cooperation of gate teams had significant influence on On-Time Arrival and Departure metrics, which could then be used as the basis for incentives <a href="#Knez2002">[Knez2002]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, both individuals and teams need coaching and direction. Team-level management and incentives must still be supplemented with some feedback loops centering on the individual. Perhaps this feedback is not compensation-based, but the organization must still identify individuals with leadership potential and deal with free riders and toxic individuals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Observed behaviors are a useful focus. Sean Landis describes the difference between behaviors and skills thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Two things make good leaders: behaviors and skills. If you focus on behaviors in your hiring of developers, they will be predisposed for leadership success. The hired candidate may walk in the door with the skills necessary to lead or not. If not, skills are easy to acquire through training and mentoring. People can acquire or modify behaviors, but it is much harder than skill development. Hire for behaviors and train the leadership skills. <a href="#Landis2011">[Landis2011]</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>He further provides many examples of behaviors, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adaptable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accountable</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initiative Taker</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimistic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relational</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conclusion - Many executives and military leaders have identified the central importance of hiring decisions over the years. In large, complex organizations, choosing the right people is the most powerful lever a leader has to drive organizational performance. As we discussed in Chapter 7 and in this chapter, the organizational context these new hires find themselves in will profoundly affect them and the results of their efforts.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We might restate the above quote as <strong>the execution of a given scope of work within constraints of time and budget</strong>. But questions arise. We are already executing work, without this concept of "project." We have discussed <a href="#2.0.4.03-scrum">Scrum</a> in Chapter 4, <a href="#2.05.02-kanban">Kanban</a> in Chapter 5, and various organizational forms for performing work in <a href="#3.07.00-Chap-7">Chapter 7</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And what is this idea of "scope"? How would we know it in advance, so that the "constraints of time and budget" are reasonable?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we have seen in our discussions of  <a href="#2.04.00-product-mgmt"> Product Management</a>, in implementing <strong>truly new products,</strong> (including digital products) estimating time and budget is virtually impossible because <strong>the necessary information is not available</strong>. In fact, creating it - which requires tight feedback loops - is the actual work of the "project". Therefore, in the new Agile world, there is some uncertainty as to the role of and even need for traditional project management. (<a href="#Cobb2015">[Cobb2015]</a> is a thorough examinination of these issues.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the project management literature and tradition, much focus is given to the <strong>execution</strong> aspect of project management - its ability to help manage complex, interdependent work across resource limitations. However, we are also interested in the <strong>structural role</strong> of project management. Project management may be institutionalized through establishing an organizational function known as the Project Management Office (PMO), which may use a concept of project portfolio as a means of constraining and managing the organization&#8217;s multiple priorities. What is the relationship of the traditional PMO to the new, product-centric, digital world?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At a practical level, project managers remain important roles and (sometimes re-labled Scrum masters) are employed in both traditional and new digital companies as overall orchestrators of complex initiatives. This chapter will examine some of the reasons for project management&#8217;s persistence and how it is adapting to the new product-centric reality.</p>

<p>In our <a href="#0.01-emergence">emergence model</a>, we always seek to make clear <strong>why</strong> we need a new concept or practice. It is not sufficient to say, "we need project management because companies of our size use it."

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start with the most fundamental aspects of a project. You can start your understanding of a project by first thinking of a "to-do" list. However, rather than a miscellaneous list of errands, a project is a to-do list that is aimed at delivering some overall end result, with certain resources and within a time frame.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, comparing to your daily life, a random list of to-dos isn&#8217;t a project, but if you are organizing your annual holiday party, that certainly would qualify as a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could start with the following list:</p>
</div>
<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all spread">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%;">
</colgroup>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td class="tableblock halign-left valign-top"><p class="tableblock">Choose menu</p></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the important characteristics of a project is that it is temporary. This project ends when we clean up after the party.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management, however, takes things much further. There are a number of ways that the list above can be refined using project management techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we should probably organize the list a little better. And the task "clean house" - do we understand precisely what we mean by that? Maybe we should break this down into sub-tasks.  Also, you may notice that there are "dependencies." For example, we can&#8217;t send out invitations before we choose the date, nor can we fix the party food before we get groceries, which in turn depends on setting the menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s break out the heavyweight tools. Introducing Microsoft Project:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-ms-proj-1.png" alt="3.08 ms proj 1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let&#8217;s set up some sub-tasks and document the dependencies:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-ms-proj-2.png" alt="3.08 ms proj 2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the bold headings:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean house before party</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Food for party</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and how they have indented "sub-tasks" underneath them. These are all the things that need to be completed, for the overall major task to be considered complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, we can&#8217;t call the house clean if the dining room isn&#8217;t vacuumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also notice that, to the right, we see certain tasks are linked by thin black arrows. We are not going to decorate the house until all the cleaning is done, and we need to get the food prepared before we have the party. As mentioned above, these are called dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we look at the schedule, we see that the time is off. The party will be on December 19, so we need to adjust the dates. In addition, let&#8217;s indicate the initials of the person who is responsible for a given task.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-ms-proj-3.png" alt="3.08 ms proj 3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg.  Much more  can be tracked in a formal project management approach, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cost of people&#8217;s time - forecast and actual</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>% complete of a given task</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which sequence of tasks is the "critical path" - the sequence that must be done in order, that will take the longest time</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A project manager is responsible for all of this and more. A critical concept is that of "deliverable." In this example, the deliverable is the outcome of each task:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>invitations sent by 11/30 by CB</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>menu decided by 12/17 by all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>house cleaned by 12/18 by all</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>food prepared for guests by 12/18 by CB</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that deliverables are defined by "what," "who,"  <strong>and</strong> "when.""</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While it is the responsibility of each contributor to the project to "meet" their deliverables, the project manager checks in regularly with each of them as to whether they will in fact be able to do this. In larger, more complex projects, the project manager updates the project plan with the effort expended to date, and the estimated time to completion. Individual status reports are assembled ("rolled up") into an overall picture of project status, reported to executives with a high level assessment of whether the project is likely to meet its objectives of cost, scope, quality, and schedule.</p>

<p>The project management <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_triangle">Iron Triangle</a> represents the interaction of cost, time, scope, and quality on a project.

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_how_is_a_project_different_from_simple_work_management">How is a project different from simple "work management"?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#2.05.00-work-management">Chapter 5</a>, we covered a simple concept of "work management" that deliberately did not differentiate product, project, and/or process-based work. As was noted at the time, for smaller organizations, most or all of the organization would be the "project team," so what would be the point?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project is starting off as a list of tasks, that is essentially identical to a product backlog. Even in Kanban, we know who is doing what, so what is the difference? Here are key points:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The project is explicitly time-bound. As a whole, it is lengthier and more flexible than the repetitive, time-boxed sprints of Scrum, but more fixed than the ongoing flow of Kanban.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dependencies. You may have had a concept of one task or story blocking another, and perhaps you used a whiteboard to outline more complex sequences of work, but project management  has an explicit concept of dependencies in the tasks, and powerful tools to manage them. This is essential in the most ambitious and complex product efforts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management also has more robust tools for managing people&#8217;s time and effort, especially as they translate to project funding. While this may be a contentious aspect of project management (see later in this chapter on the <a href="#3.08.03-NoEstimates">No Estimates</a> controversy), it remains a critical part of management practice in both IT and non-IT domains.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At the end of the day, people expect to be paid for their time, and investors expect to be compensated through the delivery of results. Investment capital only lasts as a function of an organization&#8217;s "burn rate;" the rate at which the money is consumed for salaries and expenses. Some forecasting of status (whether that of a project, organization, product, program, or what have you) is therefore an essential and unavoidable obligation of management, unless funding is unlimited (a rare situation to say the least.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project accounting, at scale, is a deep area with considerable research and theory behind it. In particular, the concept of Earned Value Management is widely used to quantify the performance of a project portfolio (more on this to come).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_a_traditional_information_technology_project">A traditional information technology project</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what does all this have to do with information technology? As we have discussed in previous chapters, project management is one of the main tools used to deliver value across specialized skill-based teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A "traditional" IT project starts with the "sponsorship" of some executive with authority to request funding. For example, suppose that the VP of Logistics under the Chief Operations Officer believes that a new supply chain system is required. With the sponsorship of the COO, they put in a request (possibly called a "demand request" although this varies by organization) to implement this system. The assumption is that a commercial software package will be acquired and implemented.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IT department serves as an overall coordinator for this project. The "demand request" in many cases is registered with the enterprise Project Management Office, which may report under the CIO.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

Why might the Enterprise Project Management office report under the CIO? IT projects in many companies represent the single largest type of internally managed capital expenditure. The other major form of projects, building projects, are usually outsourced to a general contractor.

</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project is initiated by establishing a charter, allocating the funding, assigning a project manager, establishing communication channels to stakeholders, and a variety of other activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the first major activities of the project will be to select the product to be used.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the product is chosen, the project must staff up (in reality, staffing arrangements were probably being made at the same time as the RFI/RFQ) and the systems implementation lifecycle can start.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We might call the above, the <strong>systems implementation lifecycle</strong>, not the <strong>software development lifecycle</strong>. This is because most of the hard software development was done by the third party who created the supply chain software. There may be some configuration or customization (adding new fields, screens, reports) but this is lightweight work in comparison to the software engineering required to create a system of this nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system requires its own hardware (servers, storage, perhaps a dedicated switch) and specifying this in some detail is required for the purchasing process to start. The capital investment may be hundreds of thousands, or millions of dollars. This in turn requires extensive planning and  senior executive approval for the project as a whole.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would not have been much different for a fully in house developed application, except that more money would have gone to developers. The slow infrastructure supply chain still drove much of the behavior, and correctly "sizing" this infrastructure was a challenge particularly for in-house developed software. (The vendors of commercial software would usually have a better idea of the infrastructure required for a given load.) Hence much attention to up-front planning. Without requirements, no analysis or design; without design, how to know how much server to buy?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, the project comes to an end, and the results (if a product such as a digital service) are transitioned to a "production" state. Here is a graphical depiction:</p>

<p>This might be OK for a non-competitive function, but if the "digital service consumer" has other options they may go elsewhere. If they are an internal user within an enterprise, they might be engaged in critical competitive activities.</p>

<h6 id="_the_decline_of_the_traditional_it_project">The decline of the "traditional" IT project</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above scenario is in decline, and along with it a way of life for many "IT" professionals. One primary reason is Cloud, and in particular Software as a Service.  Another reason is the increasing adoption of the Lean/Agile product development approach for digital services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is one view of the classic model:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the long triangles labeled "Producing focus" and "Consuming focus." These represent the perspectives of (for example) a software vendor versus their customer. Traditionally, the research and development (R&amp;D) function was most mature in the product companies. What was less well understood was that internal IT development was also a form of R&amp;D.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of the desire for scope management (predictability and control), the IT department performing systems development was often trapped in the worst of both worlds - having neither good quality product, nor high levels of certainty. For many years, this was accepted by industry as the best that could be expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the combination of Lean/Agile and Cloud is changing this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-ProdLifecycle4.png" alt="3.08 ProdLifecycle4">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is diminishing reason to run commodity software (e.g. payroll, expenses, HR, etc) in-house. Cloud providers such as Workday, Concur, Salesforce, and others provide ready access to the desired functionality "as a service." The responsiveness and excellence of such products is increasing, due to the increased tempo of market feedback (note that while a human resource management system may be commodity for <strong>your</strong> company, it is <strong>strategic</strong> for Workday) and concerns over security and data privacy are rapidly fading.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is left internal to the enterprise, increasingly, are those initiatives deemed "competitive" or "strategic." Usually, this means that they are going to contribute to a revenue stream. This in turn means they are "products" or significant components of them. (See Chapter 4, <a href="#2.04.00-product-mgmt">Product Management</a>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A significant market-facing product initiative (still calling for project management per se) might start with the identification of a large, interrelated set of features, perhaps termed an "epic." Hardware acquisition is a thing of the past, due to either private or public cloud. The team starts with analyzing the overall structure of the epic, decomposing it into stories and features, and organizing them into a logical sequence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because capacity is available on demand, new systems do not need to be nearly as precisely "sized," which meant that implementation could commence without as much up front analysis. Simpler architectures suffice until real load is proven. It might then be a scramble to refactor software to take advantage of new capacity, but the overall economic effect is positive, as over-engineering and over-capacity are increasingly avoided.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, IT moves in two directions - its most forward-looking elements align to the enterprise product management roadmap, while its remaining capabilities may deliver value as a "service broker." (More on this in the section on <a href="#it-sourcing">IT sourcing</a>)</p>

<p>The previous chapter discussed some typical applications of project management, starting with very simple examples and moving into more complex topics, concluding with a discussion of the evolution of IT delivery in the modern enterprises. We return to the specific topic project management with a deeper examination.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management (NOT restricted to IT) is a defined area of study, theory, and professional practice. This section provides a (necessarily brief) overview of these topics.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will first discuss the Project Management Body of Knowledge, which is the leading industry framework in project management, at least in the United States. (PRINCE2 is another framework, originating from the UK, which will not be covered in this edition.)

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Project Management Body of Knowledge is sustained by the Project Management Institute. PMI describes itself as:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>the world&#8217;s leading not-for-profit professional membership association for the project, program and portfolio management profession.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Project Management Body of Knowledge is articulated in a publication, <em>A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowlege.</em> While this may seem to imply that the PMBOK and its guide are two different things, they are not&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;it is one publication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The PMBOK, as of the latest edition, consists of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PMBOK details are easily obtained on the web, and will not be repeated here. It&#8217;s clear that the Agile critiques of waterfall project management have been taken seriously by the PMBOK thought leaders. There is now a PMI Agile certification and much explicit recognition of the need for iterative and incremental approaches to project work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PMBOK remains extensive and complex when considered as a whole. This is necessary, as it is used to manage extraordinarily complex and costly efforts in domains such as construction, military/aerospace, government, and others. Some of these efforts (especially those involving systems engineering, over and above software engineering) do have requirements for extensive planning and control that PMBOK meets well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, in Agile domains that seek to be more adaptive to changing business dynamics, full use of the PMBOK framework may be unnecessary and wasteful. The accepted response is to "tailor" the guidance, omitting those plans and deliverables that are not needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, PMBOK calls for a "stakeholder management plan" to be produced as part of the Project Stakeholder Management knowledge area and the Planning process group. The author has rarely seen this deliverable formally produced, in years of enterprise experience. However, for certain (larger) projects it may make sense.</p>

<td class="content">
Part of the problem with extensive frameworks such as PMBOK is that knowing how and when to tailor them is hard-won knowledge that is not part of the usual formalized training. And yet, without some idea of "what matters" in applying the framework, there is great risk of wasted effort. The Agile movement in some ways is a reaction to the waste that can result from overly detailed frameworks.

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_challenges_of_scope_management">The challenges of scope management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scope management is a powerful tool and concept, at the heart of the most challenging debates around project management. PMBOK uses the following definitions <a href="#PMI2013">[PMI2013]</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scope.</strong> The sum of the products, services, and results to be provided as a project. See also project scope and product scope.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scope Change.</strong> Any change to the project scope. A scope change almost always requires an adjustment to the project cost or schedule.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Scope Creep.</strong> The uncontrolled expansion to product or project scope without adjustments to time, cost, and resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="change-control"></a>
<strong>Change Control</strong> A process whereby modifications to documents, deliverables, or baselines associated with the project are identified, documented, approved, or rejected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the  <a href="#lean-startup">Lean Startup</a> world, products may pivot and pivot again, and their resource requirements may flex rapidly based on market opportunity. Formal project change control processes are in general not used. Even in larger organizations, product teams may be granted certain leeway to adapt their "products, services, and results" and while such adaptations need to be transparent, formal project change control is not the vehicle used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, remember our <a href="#0.01-emergence">emergence model</a>. The simple organizational change from one to multiple products may provoke certain concerns and a new kind of contention for resources. People are inherently competitive and also have a sense of fairness. A new product team that seems to be unaccountable for results, consuming "more than its share" of budget while failing to meet the original vision for their existence, will cause conflict and concern among organizational leadership.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is in the tension between product autonomy and accountability that we see project management techniques such as the work breakdown structure and project change control employed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We saw a Work Breakdown Structure in the previous section, with our discussion of a holiday party. More formally, the work breakdown structure is defined by the Project Management Body of Knowledge as</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>&#8230;&#8203;a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables. The WBS organizes and defines the total scope of the project, and represents the work specified in the current approved project</em> <a href="#PMI2013">[PMI2013]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#Portny2013">[Portny2013]</a> recommends "Subdivide your WBS component into additional deliverables if you think either of the following situations applies: The component will take much longer than two calendar weeks to complete. The component will require much more than 80 person-hours to complete.''</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may seem reasonable, but in iterative product development, it can be difficult to "decompose" a problem in the way project management seems to require. Or to estimate in the way Portny suggests. This can lead to two problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, the WBS may be created at a seemingly appropriate level of detail, but since it is created before key information is generated, it is inevitably wrong and needing ongoing correction. If the project management approach requires a high-effort "project change management" process, much waste may result as "approvals" are sought for each  <a href="#2.00.01-feedback">feedback</a> cycle. This may result in increasing disregard by the development team for the project manager and his/her plan, and corresponding cultural risks of disengagement and lowering of trust on all sides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, we may see the creation of project plans that are too high level, omitting information that is in fact known at the time - for example, external deadlines or resource constraints. This happens because the team develops a cultural attitude that is averse to all planning and estimation. (See the discussion on <a href="#3.08.03-NoEstimates">No Estimates</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_task_ordering_dependencies_and_critical_path">Task ordering, dependencies, and critical path</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The specific ordering of tasks is also important. As we saw in the holiday party example, sometimes one cannot complete a task without first completing something else - e.g., you cannot buy groceries until you decide on the menu. Or install software before the server is configured. But many other tasks might be performed in any order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Sometimes, the tasks are constrained by the availability of someone to work on them. This is the situation we have in simple Kanban, where a backlog of tasks is worked primarily according to the availability of someone to work on them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are other approaches to scheduling tasks. <a href="#Portny2013">[Portny2013]</a> suggests the following approach types:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Basic</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Procedural</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Legal/regulatory</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Optimization-based</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arbitrary (no reason for precedence chosen, but once resources are planned, hard to change)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When tasks are ordered, and their time to complete estimated, an analysis known as <strong>critical path</strong> is possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>PMBOK <a href="#PMI2013">[PMI2013]</a> defines the critical path as "The sequence of activities that represents the longest path through a project, which determines the shortest possible duration."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider our holiday party plan again:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-ms-proj-3.png" alt="3.08 ms proj 3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above example, we have two major work areas: clean the house and prepare a menu. Note however that there are no dependencies between:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>vacuum living room</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clean kitchen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>clean dining table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>vacuum dining room</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Really, they can be done in any order.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other hand, there is a clear set of dependencies between:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Choose menu</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get groceries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix food</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that the sub-activity "Food for party" is the critical path. If the menu is not determined on time, the grocery run can&#8217;t happen, and the food will be fixed late or not at all.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>While this book does not go into systems architectural styles in depth, a project with a large number of dependencies may be an indication that the system or product being constructed also has significant interdependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Successful systems designers for years have relied on concepts such as encapsulation, abstraction, and loose coupling to minimize the dependencies between components of complex systems, so that their design, construction, and operation can be managed with some degree of independence. These ideas are core to the software engineering literature.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recent expressions of these core ideas are Services-Oriented Architecture and microservices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Systems that do not adopt such approaches are often termed "monolithic" and have a well deserved reputation for being problematic to build and operate. Many large software failures stem from such approaches. (cites)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The system development efforts that gave rise to Critical Path Analysis (in particular the Polaris submarine) were very different from modern digital product development. A submarine is a relatively closed system with many constraints. They are changed only through the most formal of processes. (Even so, military systems seek loose coupling wherever possible.) Modern digital systems, while presenting their own challenges, do not operate under such constraints.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a project plan with excessive dependencies, the question at least should be asked: does my massive, tightly-coupled project plan indicate I am building a monolithic, tightly-coupled system that will not be flexible or responsive to change?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, many digital companies build tremendously robust integrated services from the combination of many quasi-independent "product" teams, each serving a particular function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/753804.Small_Pieces_Loosely_Joined">Small Pieces Loosely Joined: A Unified Theory Of The Web</a> is a good discussion of these ideas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, when a particular organizational objective requires changes to more than one such "product," the need for cross-team coordination emerges. Someone needs to own this larger objective, even if its actual implementation is carried out across multiple distinct teams.</p>
</div>

<p>In this discussion we see the emergence of enterprise architecture, which will be discussed in depth in Chapter 12.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management is where we see the first formalization of risk management (which will be more extensively covered in Chapter 10). Briefly, risk is classically defined as the probability of an adverse event times its cost. Project managers are alert to risks to their timelines, resource estimates, and deliverables.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Risks may be formally identified in project management tooling. They may be accepted, avoided, transferred, or mitigated. Unmanaged risks to a project may result in the project as a whole reporting an unfavorable status.</p>

<p>To understand how project management works across a functionally organized system, consider the internals of each functional area:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-mfg-w-resource.png" alt="3.08 mfg w resource">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each combination of worker and equipment can be considered a workstation in this simplified model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is concern for flow across the functional areas, one technique used in manufacturing is that of expediting. An individual in the role of  "expeditor" tracks the process across the work stations and ensures that any friction or blockages are overcome so that the entire process completes and value is delivered. This can be seen as a preliminary form of project management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the production line evolves, scheduling may be used as well: the assignment of work to each workstation (combination of worker and equipment) may have its timing and duration specified in advance. While this is not an optimal approach according to Lean philosophy (which emphasizes "pull" techniques), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(production_processes)">production scheduling</a> is widely used in manufacturing.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT systems development, when crossing functions, is rarely if ever considered as a simple end to end process that can run itself, with only a lightweight expeditor. Instead, since there is substantially increased complexity, a project paradigm is used across the functions. The project manager plays the role of expanded expeditor:</p>

<p>The above diagram, which you should study carefully, is a more detailed representation of the classic "waterfall" project. It still bears strong similarities to the idealized manufacturing model presented just previously. In particular, notice that the default model is that <strong>the need for the resource is tightly bounded by the calendar</strong>. In the above model, the following resource requirements are apparent:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>One Requirements analyst is needed between times A and B (e.g, from May 1 through 15).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Architect is needed between times B and C (e.g., from May 16 through 31)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Developer is needed between times C and D (e.g., from June 1 through 15)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One Release Engineer is needed between times D and E (e.g., from June 15 through 30)</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>This is a deliberately unworkable model for illustration.</strong> (But the author can attest it has been tried&#8230;&#8203;) Sometimes, the terms "mechanistic," "deterministic," or "linear" are used to describe waterfall project methods. This shows them at their extreme, insofar as they are essentially translations of a manufacturing model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic problem: if the Developer is released from the project on June 15, and issues were to arise on June 20 with the release, flow would be interrupted and the system would not be delivered successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this, the project may retain some residual claim on all the engaged resources, but their utilization may be low or zero at certain points.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we re-imagine the diagram with the different functional areas along the horizontal, we start to develop an understanding of the interrelatedness of product development. The following is one representation of the Rational Unified Process, an early depiction of this interrelatedness:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="float: right">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One interesting aspect of the diagram is that it shows just how difficult it can be to staff a project. Demand for given functional roles ebbs and flows unpredictably. The project manager is expected to manage the uncertain handoffs between the various functional areas, and anticipate resource requirements stemming from unexpected feedback demands. This is why "T-shaped" professionals (see Chapter 7) are desirable, because they can move from area to area in response to demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ultimately, the reason classical production scheduling is inappropriate for delivering new IT functionality is that there is simply too much variability in <a href="#2.04.00-product-mgmt">product development</a> . (Again see Chapter 4 for further discussion of this.) However, this does not change the fact that some level of planning and estimation is needed. To what extent this more variable IT work can be quantitatively managed is an active area of discussion in the software, Agile, and related communities.</p>

<p>This may appear to work mathematically, but practically it is an ineffective practice. Both Gene Kim in The Phoenix Project <a href="#Kim2013">[Kim2013]</a> and Eli Goldratt in Critical Chain <a href="#Goldratt1997">[Goldratt1997]</a> present dramatized accounts of the overburden and gridlock that can result from such approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Human beings are notably bad at multi-tasking, and the mental "context-switching" required to move from one task to another is wasteful and ultimately not scalable. A human being fractionally allocated to more and more projects will get less and less done in total, as the transactional friction of task switching increases.</p>

<h6 id="_critical_chain">Critical chain</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Goldratt in the above-cited book Critical Chain develops a sophisticated critique of project estimation and the dysfunctions it promotes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a project requiring contributions from multiple skilled resources, a common practice is to ask each person, "how long will this take you?" The project manager then works the resulting estimates into the overall project plan.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem with this is that most people will estimate their time conservatively; they will forecast a longer duration than they actually require. When all these "padded" estimates are added together, the project may be unacceptably long. The agreed work will tend to expand to fill the time available (Parkinson&#8217;s Law). Furthermore, most people will wait until the end of their window to perform their task - a person who asks for 3 weeks to perform one week of work will often not start until week 3. (Otherwise known as Student Syndrome.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the reasons that people estimate conservatively is that project managers tend to be quite concerned if committed tasks are not performed on time. Failure to make the "deliverable" by the committed date may result in negative feedback to the employee&#8217;s manager and resulting poor performance reviews.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Coupled with the above-cited drive to multi-tasking, these factors result in poor project performance, despite the array of modern project management techniques.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Goldratt suggested an alternate approach, in which the idea of "critical path" is enhanced with resource awareness. That is to say, the issue of timing and dependencies (itself a complex problem) is further enriched with the availability of resources to perform the work. (In general, the availability of assigned project resources is assumed, but this is not a wise assumption in project-centric environments.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Estimation is handled more probabilistically, and the "critical chain" is <strong>the combination of the critical path plus the resource assigned to complete the most critical task.</strong> The theory is that a person performing such a task must be protected from distraction, and in fact project managers must expand their tools to effectively forecast and plan the critical chain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This leads to some complex math, in particular a known problem called the Resource-Constrained Scheduling Problem. (e.g. <a href="http://www.iste.co.uk/data/doc_dtalmanhopmh.pdf" class="bare">http://www.iste.co.uk/data/doc_dtalmanhopmh.pdf</a>) The fact that this problem is so notoriously difficult is indicative of the need for adaptive approaches; ultimately, rigorous analytic methods fail to cope with the complexity of such problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Craig Larman, in Scaling Lean and Agile Development, is sympathetic to the overall insights and goals of Critical Chain. However, with respect the full blown analytical approach it implies, he states</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We have seen two very large official "project management TOC" adoption attempts (and heard of one more) in companies developing software-intensive embedded systems&#8230;&#8203; The practice was clearly heavy, not agile, and not lean.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the above quotes indicate, there are diverse opinions on the role and importance of traditional project management in the enterprise. Clearly it is under pressure from the Agile movement. Project management professionals are advised to not deny or diminish this fact. One of the primary criticisms of project management as a paradigm is that it promotes large "batches" of work. It is possible for a modern, IT-centric organization to make considerable progress on the basis of <a href="#2.04.00-product-mgmt">product management</a> plus simple <a href="#2.05.00-work-management">work management</a>, without the overhead of the formalized project lifecycle suggested by PMBOK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cloud is having impacts on traditional project management as well. As noted in the section on the <a href="#trad-IT-decline">decline of traditional IT</a>, projects were often used to install vendor-delivered commodity software, such as for payroll or employee expense. Increasingly, that kind of functionality is delivered by online service providers, leaving "traditional" internal IT with considerably reduced responsibilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of the IT capability may remain in the guise of an internal "service broker," to assist with the sourcing and procurement of online services. The remainder moves into digital product management, as the only need for internal IT is in the area of revenue-generating, market-facing strategic digital product.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, this section will examine the following questions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Given the above trends, under what circumstances does formalized project management make economic sense?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assuming that formalized project management is employed, how does one continue to support objectives such as fast feedback and adaptability?</p>

<p>As we discussed in the <a href="#3.07.00-Chap-7">Chapter 7</a>, we are introducing multiple feature teams as our product scales up:</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-multi-feature.png" alt="3.08 multi feature">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The decision process by which the features are identified is still informal (we will not formalize this until Chapter 12.) However, the term "architecture" is likely emerging through these discussions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted in the discussion of <a href="#loose-coupling-project">loose coupling and project management</a>, some needs for coordination may be mitigated through the design of the product itself. If the features and components have well defined protocols for their interaction and clear contracts for matters like performance, development on each team can move forward with some autonomy.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>The reality of microservices and loose coupling: the case of Chubby at Google</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea that architecture can "emerge" across a set of smaller grained services ("microservices"), without explicit coordination, is attractive. Coordinating designs across products is expensive and ideally products should be able to evolve independently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mike Burrows of Google provides a detailed description of the Chubby lock service <a href="#Burrows2006">[Burrows2006]</a>, which is a prototypical example of a broadly-available internal service usable by a wide variety of other products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The purpose of a lock service is to "allow its clients to synchronize their activities and to agree on basic information about their environment." Chubby was built from the start with objectives of reliability, availability to a "moderately large set of clients," and ease of understanding.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Burrows notes that even with such a cohesive and well-designed internal service, they still encounter coordination problems requiring human intervention. Such problems include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use ("abuse") in unintended ways by clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid assumptions by clients regarding Chubby&#8217;s availability</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because of this, the Chubby team (at least at the time writing of the case study) instituted a review process when new clients wished to start using the lock manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of this chapter&#8217;s topic, this means that someone on the product team needed to coordinate the discussions with the Chubby team and ensure that any concerns were resolved. This might conceivably have involved multiple iterations and reviews of designs describing intended use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In short, even the most sophisticated microservice environments may require some level of  human coordination across the teams. Project management provides a framework for doing this and encourages the development of appropriate skills.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But at scale, complexity is inevitable. What happens when a given business objective requires coordinated effort across multiple teams?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an online ecommerce site might find itself overwhelmed by business success. Upgrading the site to accommodate the new demand might require distinct development work to be performed by most or all of the teams:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.08-multi-feature-coord.png" alt="3.08 multi feature coord">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As the quote from Gary Hamel above indicates, a central point of coordination and accountability is advisable, otherwise the objective is at risk. (It becomes "someone else&#8217;s problem.")</p>

<p>In keeping with the <a href="#0.01-emergence">emergence model</a> thought experiment, another key state transition is from one product to multiple products.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is substantially distinct from scaling one product through subdividing it into multiple features.</p>

<p>Consider our hypothetical startup company:</p>

<p>When everyone on the team is supporting one product and dedicated to its success, there is less sense of contention with "others" in the organization. This changes dramatically with the addition of a second product. Concerns for fair allocation and a sense of internal competition naturally arise out of this diversification.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beecause resources are always limited, it is critical that the demands of each product be managed using objective criteria, requiring formalization.  This was a different problem when you were a tight-knit startup; you were constrained, but everyone knew they were "in it together." Now you need some ground rules to support your increasingly diverse activities. This leads to new concerns:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Managing scope and preventing unintended creep or drift from the product&#8217;s original charter</p>

<li>
<p>Execution to timeframes (e.g. the critical trade show)</p>

<h6 id="_why_project_management_2">Why project management?</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management provides tools addressing these issues, which is why it is widely used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are a number of issues in doing so.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Projects are by definition temporary, while products may last as long as there is market demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project management methodology, with its emphasis on predictability, scope management, and change control often conflicts with the product management objective of discovering information (see the discussion of <a href="#2.04.04-lean-product-dev">Lean Product Development</a>.)</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>But not all product management activities involve the creation of new information!</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Scope, execution, limited resources, and dependencies exist throughout digital business. A product manager with no understanding of these issues, or tools to deal with them, will likely fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product managers should therefore be familiar with the basic concepts of project management. The project paradigm has a benefit in its explicit limitation of time and money, and the sense of urgency this creates. However, the way in which project management is implemented, the degree of formality, will vary according to need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what of project management in this new world? A project manager may still be required, to facilitate discussions, record decisions, and keep the team on track to its stated direction and commitments. Regardless of whether the team considers itself "Agile," people are sometimes bad at taking notes or being consistent in their usage of tools such as Kanban boards and standups.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also useful to have a third party who is knowledgeable about the product, yet has some emotional distance from its success. This can be a difficult balance to strike, but the existence of the role of Scrum coach is indicative of its importance.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_governing_outsourced_work">Governing outsourced work</h6>

<h5 id="_organizational_tools_and_techniques">Organizational tools and techniques</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our previous discussion of <a href="#2.05.00-work-management">work management</a>was a simple, idealized flow of uniform demand (new product functionality, issues, etc). Tasks in general did not have dependencies, or dependencies were handled through ad-hoc coordination. We also in general assumed that resources (people) were available to perform the tasks; resource contention, while it certainly may have come up, was again handled through ad-hoc means.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we progress on our journey and continue to scale up, we see that dependencies and resource management have become defining concerns, and the concept of "project management" is a primary response. However, we retain our concern for fast feedback and adaptability, as well as a critical approach to the idea that complex initiatives can be precisely defined and simply executed through <a href="#2.00.1-open-loop">open loop</a> approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Above, we&#8217;ve discussed a few aspects of the coordination problem including the emergent issues when needed capabilities span feature teams, and when new product lines are introduced. In this section, we will discuss some of the organizational responses (techniques and tools) that have emerged as proven responses to these emergent issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The general problem is, "how do I facilitate the adaptive generation of information under conditions of time and space shifting." That is to say:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>digital product development (as all R&amp;D) is essentially <a href="#2.04.04-lean-product-dev">information generation</a></p>

<li>
<p>as it scales up, we encounter emergent coordination needs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that present rapidly increasing combinatoric complexity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that may be exacerbated by time and space shifting</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have seen earlier versions of this problem in our discussions of work management. However, simple Kanban and visual Andon is no longer sufficient, given the nature of the coordination we now require. We need a more diverse and comprehensive set of techniques.</p>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_co_location">Co-location</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don Reinertsen (<a href="#Reinertsen2009">[Reinertsen2009]</a>, p. 230), proposes "The Principle of Colocation" which asserts that "Colocation improves almost all aspects of communication." In order to scale this, one logically needs what Mike Cohn (<a href="#Cohn2010">[Cohn2010]</a>, p. 346) calls "The Big Room."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of communications, this has significant organizational advantages. Communications are as simple as walking over to another person&#8217;s desk, or just shouting out over the room. It is also easy to synchronize the entire room, through calling for everyone&#8217;s attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there are limits to scaling the "Big Room" approach:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>Contention for key individual&#8217;s attention</p>

<li>

<p>A variety of liaison and coordination approaches are suggested by Mike Cohn (<a href="#Cohn2010">[Cohn2010]</a>, Chapter 17, "Scaling Scrum") including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shared team members</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Shared team members</strong> are suggested when two teams have a persistent interface requiring focus and ownership. When a product has multiple interfaces that emerge as a problem requiring focus, an <strong>integration team</strong> may be called for. <strong>Communities of practice</strong> were introduced in Chapter 7 as we discussed the <a href="#spotify-model">Spotify model</a>. Considered here, they may also play a coordination role as well as a practice development/maturity role.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the idea of a "scrum of scrums" is essentially a representative or delegated model, in which each individual Scrum team sends one individual to a periodic coordination meeting where matters of cross-team concern can be discussed and decisions taken.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#Cohn2010">[Cohn2010]</a> (p342) cautions: "A scrum of scrums meeting will feel nothing like a daily scrum despite the similarities in names. The daily scrum is a synchronization meeting: individual team members come together to communicate about their work and synchronize their efforts.The scrum of scrums, on the other hand, is a problem-solving meeting and will not have the same quick, get-in-get-out tone of a daily scrum."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="submittal-schedule"></a>
Another perspective on this is found in The Checklist Manifesto <a href="#Gawande2010">[Gawande2010]</a>. Some work, while detailed, can be planned to a high degree of detail (i.e. the "checklists" of the title). However, emergent complexity requires different approach - no checklist can anticipate all eventualities. To handle all the emergent complexity, the coordination focus must shift to structuring the right communications. In examining modern construction industry techniques, Gawande noted the concept of the "submittal schedule," which "didn&#8217;t specify construction tasks; it specified <em>communication</em> tasks" (p. 65, emphasis supplied).</p>

<p>Taken together, the three represent a coherent set of concerns for value delivery in various forms. But in isolation, any one of them ultimately is limited. This is a particular challenge for project management, whose practitioners may identify deeply with their chosen field of expertise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearly, formalized project management is under pressure. Its methods are perceived by the Agile community as overly heavyweight; its practitioners are criticized for focusing too much on success in terms of cost and schedule performance and not enough on business outcomes. Because projects are by definition temporary, project managers have little incentive to care about <a href="#technical-debt-1">technical debt</a> or operational consequences. Hence the rise of the product manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, a product manager who does not understand the fundamentals of project execution will not succeed. As we have seen, modern products, especially in organizations scaling up, have dependencies and coordination needs, and to meet those needs, project management tools will continue to provide value.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>IT sourcing</strong> is the set of concerns related to identifying suppliers (sources) of the necessary inputs to deliver digital value. <strong>Contract management</strong> is a critical, subsidiary concern, where digital value intersects with law.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic classes of inputs include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>People (with certain skills and knowledge)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Services (which themselves are composed of people, hardware, and/or software)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Practically speaking, these inputs are handled by two different functions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>People (in particular, full time employees) are handled by a Human Resources function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware, software, and services are handled by a Procurement function. Other terms associated with this are Vendor Management, Contract Management, and Supplier Management. We will not attempt to clarify or rationalize these areas in this section.</p>

<p><strong>Case study: Choosing a telecommunications provider</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When Company X was a startup, its telecommunications needs were limited, as were its options. The founder had one choice for Internet access, the local cable company. Even when the company moved to a larger space, as a single team startup, its options were limited.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, it is now a company of 50, and moving yet again to a new headquarters where there are a variety of options for network carriers. The company is known to be growing and three telecommunications companies ("carriers") have been sending sales representatives periodically to inquire if their services might be needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the move to a new facility, some systematic effort must be undertaken to choose an appropriate provider. This becomes a sub-project in its own right, part of the larger program required to effectively complete the move.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As part of this project, a formal "Request for Information" (RFI) is sent to all the potential carriers. Part of this RFI consists of a lengthy series of questions, such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What kinds of circuits are available?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is their territory?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How much data can they handle?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What do they cost (at a high level)?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How are they secured?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How stable are they (how often are they "down")?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are co-location services available (can the carrier host the company&#8217;s servers in its data centers?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What other services does the carrier provide?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The responses to these questions are "scored" (assigned a numeric weighting) and the 2 top scoring vendors are issued a Request for Quote (RFQ). The RFQ goes into much more detail in terms of the contract the carrier is willing to offer. After extensive discussions and negotiations, Company X&#8217;s contract team awards the business to the carrier they believe will provide the greatest value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same approach is used to establish relationships with Cloud vendors, software providers, and consultants. In fact, because the approach is so consistent, it is considered a repeatable "process." See the chapter on <a href="#chap-process-mgmt">process management</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A small company may establish binding agreements with vendors relatively casually. For example, when the founder first chose a Cloud platform on which to build their product, they clicked on a button that said "I accept," at the bottom of a lengthy legal document they didn&#8217;t necessarily read closely. This "clickwrap" agreement is a legally binding contract, which means that the terms and conditions it specifies are enforceable by the courts.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Figure: Example of clickwrap licensing</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A startup may be inattentive to the full implications of its contracts for various reasons:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The founder does not understand the importance and consequences of legally binding agreements</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The founder understands, but feels they have little to lose (for example, they have incorporated as a limited liability company, meaning the founder&#8217;s personal assets are not at risk)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The service is perceived to be so broadly used that an agreement with it must be safe (if 50 other startups are using a well known Cloud provider and prospering, why would a startup founder spend precious time and money on overly detailed scrutiny of its agreements?)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these assumptions bear some risk&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and many startups have been burned on such matters&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;but there are many other, perhaps more pressing risks for the founder and startup. See the case study on the <a href="#9-figure-true-up">9 figure true-up</a> for a grim scenario.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, by the time the company has scaled to the team of teams level, contract management is almost certainly a concern of the Chief Financial Officer. The company has more resources ("deeper pockets") and so lawsuits start to become a concern. The complexity of the company&#8217;s services may require more specialized terms and conditions. Standard "boilerplate" contracts thus are replaced by individualized agreements. Concerns over intellectual property, the ability to terminate agreements, liability for damages, and other topics require increased negotiation and counterproposing contractual language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, the company may have hired its own legal professional; certainly, legal fees are going up, whether as services from external law firms or internal staff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contract and vendor management is more than just establishing the initial agreement. The ongoing relationship must be monitored for its consistency with the contract. If the vendor agrees that its service will be available 99.999% of the time, the availability of that service should be measured and if it falls below that threshhold, contractual penalties may need to be applied.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In larger organizations, where a vendor might hold multiple contracts, a concept of "Vendor Management" emerges. Vendors may be provided "scorecards" that aggregate metrics describing their performance and the overall impression of the customer. Perhaps key stakeholders are internally surveyed as to their impression of the vendor&#8217;s performance and whether they would be likely to recommend them again. Low scores may penalize a vendor&#8217;s chances in future RFI/RFP processes; high scores may enhance them. Finally, advising on sourcing is one of the main services an <a href="#chap-arch-portfolio">Enterprise Architecture</a> group may provide.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As software and digital services are increasingly used by firms large and small, the contractual rights of usage become more and more critical.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We mentioned a "clickwrap" licensing agreement above. Software licensing in general is a large and detailed topic, one presenting substantial financial risk to the unwary firm, especially when Cloud and virtualization are concerned.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Case study: The 9-figure "true-up"</strong>
A large enterprise had a long relationship with a major software vendor, who provided a critical software product used widely for many purposes across the enterprise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The price for this product was set based on the power of the computer running it. A license would cost less for computer with 4 cores and 1 gigabyte of RAM, than it would for a computer with 16 cores and 8 gigabytes of RAM. The largest computers required the most expensive licenses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As described previously, the goal of <a href="#virtualization">virtualization</a> is to use one powerful physical computer to consolidate more lightly-loaded computers as "virtual machines." This can provide significant savings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Over the course of 3 years, the enterprise described here virtualized about 5,000 formerly physical computers, each of which had been running the vendor&#8217;s software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, a deadly wrinkle emerged in the software vendor&#8217;s licensing terms. The formerly physical computers were in general smaller machines. The new virtual farms were clusters of 16 of the most powerful computers available on the market. The vendor held that EACH of the 5,000 instances of its software running in the virtual machines was liable for the FULL licensing fee applicable to the most powerful machine!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Even though each of the 5,000 virtual machines could not possibly have been using the full capacity of the virtual farm, the vendor insisted (and was upheld) that the contract did not account for that, and there was no way of knowing whether any given VM had been using the full capacity of the farm at some point.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dispute escalated to the CEOs of each company, but the vendor held firm. The enterprise was obliged to pay a "true-up" charge of over $100 million (9 figures).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not an isolated instance. Major software vendors have earned billions in such charges and continue to audit aggressively for these kinds of scenarios. This is why contracts and licenses should never be taken lightly. Even startups could be vulnerable, if licensed commercial software is used in un-authorized ways in a Cloud environment, for example.</p>

<h5 id="_the_role_of_industry_analysts">The role of industry analysts</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a company is faced by a sourcing question of any kind, one initial reaction is to research the market alternatives. But research is time consuming and markets are large and complex. Therefore, the role of industry or market analyst has developed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the financial media, one often hears from "industry analysts" who are concerned with whether a company is a good investment in the stock market. While there is some overlap, the industry analysts we are concerned with here are more focused on advising prospective customers of a given market&#8217;s offerings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because sourcing and contracting is an infrequent activity, especially for smaller companies, it is valuable to have such services. Because they are researching a market and talking to vendors and customers on a regular basis, analysts can be helpful to companies in the purchasing process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, analysts take money from the vendors they are covering as well, leading to occasional charges of conflict of interest [cite]. How does this work? There are a couple of ways.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, the analyst firm engages in objective research of a given market segment. They do this by developing a common set of criteria for who gets included, and a detailed set of questions to assess their capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, an analyst firm might define a market segment of "Cloud Infrastructure as a Service" vendors. Only vendors supporting the basic NIST guidelines for Infrastructure as a Service are invited. Then, the analyst might ask, "Do you support Software Defined Networking, e.g. Network Function Virtualization" as a question. Companies that answer "yes" will be given a higher score than companies that answer "no." The number of questions on a major research report might be as high as 300 or even higher.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the report is completed and the vendors are ranked (analyst firms typically use a two-dimensional ranking, such as the Gartner Magic Quadrant), it is made available to end users for a fee. Fees for such research might range from $500 to $5000 or more, depending on how specialized the topic, how difficult the research, and the ability to pay of prospective customers.</p>

Large companies, e.g. those in the Fortune 500, typically would purchase an "enterprise agreement", often defined as a named "seat" for an individual, who can then access entire categories of research.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Customers may have further questions for the analyst who wrote the research. They may be entitled to some portion of analyst time as part of their license, or they may pay extra for this privilege.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond selling the research to potential customers of a market, the analyst firm has a complex relationship with the vendors they are covering. In our example of a major market research report, the analyst firm&#8217;s sales team also reaches out the vendors who were covered. The conversation goes something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Greetings. You did very well in our recent research report. Would you like to be able to give it away to prospective customers, with your success highlighted? If so, you can sponsor the report for $50,000."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the analyst report is seen as having some independence, it can be an attractive marketing tool for the vendor, who will often pay (after some negotiating) for the sponsorship. In fact, vendors have so many opportunities along these lines they often find it necessary to establish a function known as "Analyst Relations" to manage all of them.</p>

<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Arbogast et  al<br>
<cite>Agile Contracts Primer</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software is often developed and delivered per contractual terms. Contracts are legally binding agreements, typically developed with the assistance of lawyers. As noted in <a href="#Arbogast2012">[Arbogast2012]</a> (p.5),  "Legal professionals are trained to act, under legal duty, to
advance their client’s interests and protect them against all pitfalls, seen or unseen." The idea of "customer collaboration over contract negotiation" may strike them as the height of naivete. However, Agile and Lean influences have made substantial inroads in contracting approaches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Arbogast et al. describe the general areas of contract concern:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Risk, exposure, and liability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Flexibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clarity of obligations, expectations, and deliverables</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They argue that "An agile-project contract may articulate the same limitations of liability (and related terms) as a traditional-project contract, but the agile contract will better support avoiding the very problems that a lawyer is worried about." (p. 12)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is an agile contract?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two major classes of contracts:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Time and materials</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed price</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a <strong>time and materials</strong> contract, the contracting firm simply pays the provider until the work is done. This means that the risk of the project overrunning its schedule or budget resides primarily with the firm hiring out the work. While this can work, there is often a desire on the part of the firm to reduce this risk. If you are hiring someone because they claim they are experts, and can do the work better/cheaper/quicker than your own staff, it seems reasonable that they should be willing to shoulder some of the risk.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a <strong>fixed price</strong> contract, the vendor providing the service will make a binding commitment that (for example) "we will get the software completely written in 9 months for $3 million." Penalties may be enforced if the software is late, and it&#8217;s up to the vendor to control development costs. If the vendor does not understand the work correctly, they may lose money on the deal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Reconciling Agile with fixed-price contracting approaches has been a challenging topic <a href="#Opelt2013">[Opelt2013]</a>. The desire for control over a contractual relationship is historically one of the major drivers of <a href="#1.03.02-Agile-history">waterfall</a> approaches. However, since requirements cannot be known in advance, this is problematic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a contract is signed based on waterfall assumptions, the project management process of <a href="#change-control">change control</a> is typically used to govern any alterations to the scope of the effort. Each change order typically implies some increase in cost to the customer. Because of this, the perceived risk mitigation of a fixed price contract may become a false premise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This problem has been understood for some time. Scott Ambler argued in 2005 that "It&#8217;s time to abandon the idea that fixed bids reduce risk. Clients have far more control over a project with a variable, gated approach to funding in which working software is delivered on a regular basis" <a href="#Ambler2005">[Ambler2005]</a>. Andreas Opelt states, "For agile IT projects it is therefore necessary to find an agreement that supports the balance between a fixed budget (maximum price range) and agile development (scope not yet defined in detail)&#8230;&#8203;"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How is this done? Opelt and his co-authors further argue that the essential question revolves around the project "iron triangle":</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scope</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deadline</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The approach they recommend is determining which of these elements is the "fixed point" and which is estimated. In traditional waterfall projects, scope is fixed, while costs and deadline must be estimated (a problematic approach when <a href="#2.04.04-lean-product-dev">product development</a> is required.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Opelt&#8217;s view, in Agile contracting, costs and deadline are fixed, while scope is "estimated" - understood to have some inevitable variability. "&#8230;&#8203;you never know exactly what details will be needed at the start of a project. On the other hand, you do not always need everything that had originally been considered to be important" <a href="#Opelt2013">[Opelt2013]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Their recommended approach supports the following benefits:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Simplified adaptation to change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Non-punitive changes in scope</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced knowledge decay (large "batches" of requirements degrade in value over time)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is achieved through:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Defining the contract at the level of product or project vision (epics or high-level stories; see discussion of <a href="#2.0.4.03-scrum">Scrum</a>) - not detailed specification</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Developing high-level estimation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing agreement for sharing the risk of product development variability</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This last point, which Opelt et al term "riskshare," is key. If the schedule or cost expand beyond the initial estimate, both the supplier and the customer pay, according to some agreed %, which they recommend be between 30%-70%. If the supplier proportion is too low, the contract becomes essentially time &amp; materials. If the customer proportion is too low, the contract starts to resemble traditional fixed-price.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Incremental checkpoints are also essential; for example, the supplier/customer interactions should be high bandwidth for the first few sprints, while culture and expectations are being established and the project is developing a rhythm.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the ability for either party to exit gracefully and with minimum penalty is needed. If the initiative is testing market response (ala <a href="#lean-startup">Lean Startup</a>)
and the product hypothesis is falsified, there is little point to continuing the work from the customer&#8217;s point of view. AND, if the product vision turns out to be far more work than either party estimated, the supplier should be able to walk away  (or at least insist on comprehensive re-negotiation.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These ideas are a departure from traditional contract management. As Opelt asks, "How can you sign a contract from which one party can exit at any time?" Recall however that (if Agile principles are applied) the customer is receiving working software continuously through the engagement (e.g. after every sprint).</p>

Computers initially were used to automate manual operations and the benefits were relatively easy to forecast. As organizations use computers more for strategic purposes and management information enhancements, the benefits become harder to forecast. In a growing number of companies the individuals most qualified to forecast the most significant costs and benefits are product managers, financial specialists, marketing specialists, and not the I/S technical specialists . . .

<p>An annual budgeting cycle, in which project funding is decided</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
IT organizations typically adhere to annual budgeting and planning cycles—which can involve painful rebalancing exercises across an entire portfolio of technology initiatives, as well as a sizable amount of rework and waste. This approach is anathema to companies that are seeking to deploy agile at scale. Some businesses in our research base are taking a different approach. Overall budgeting is still done yearly, but road maps and plans are revisited quarterly or monthly, and projects are reprioritized continually. <a href="#Comella2016">[Comella2016]</a>
</blockquote>
<div class="attribution">
&#8212; Comella-Dorda et al<br>
<cite>An Operating Model for Company-Wide Agile Development</cite>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the common practice of the annual budget cycle, companies once a year embark on a detailed planning effort to forecast revenues and how they will be spent. Much emphasis is placed on the accuracy of such forecasts, despite its near-impossibility. (If estimating one large software project is challenging, how much more challenging to estimate an entire enterprise&#8217;s income and expenditures?)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The annual budget has two primary components: capital expenditures and operating expenditures, commonly called CapEx and OpEx. The rules about what must go where are fairly rigid and determined by accounting standards with some leeway for the organization&#8217;s preferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Software development can be capitalized, as it is an investment from which the company hopes to benefit from in the future. Operations is typically expensed. Capitalized activities may be accounted for over multiple years (therefore becoming a reasonable candidate for financing and multi-year amortization.) Expensed activities must be accounted for in-year.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because one can only "go to the well" once a year, extensive planning and negotiation traditionally take place around the IT project portfolio. Business units and their IT partners debate the priorities for the capital budget, assess resources, and finalize a list of investments. Project managers are identified and tasked with marshaling the needed resources for execution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This annual cycle receives much criticism in the Agile and Lean communities. From a Lean perspective, projects can be equated to large "batches" of work. Using annual projects as a basis for investment can result in misguided attempts to plan large batches of complex work in great detail, so that resource requirements can be known well in advance. The history of the Agile movement is in many ways a challenge and correction of this thinking, as we have discussed throughout this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The execution model for digital/IT acquisition adds further complexity. Traditionally, project management has been the major funding vehicle for capital investments, distinct from operational expense. But with the rise of Cloud computing and product-centric management, companies are moving away from traditional capital projects. New products are created with greater agility, in response to market need, and without the large capital investments of the past in physical hardware.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This does not mean that traditional accounting distinctions between capex and opex go away. Even with expensed Cloud infrastructure services, software development may still be capitalized, as may software licenses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_cost_accounting_and_chargeback">Cost accounting and chargeback</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT is often consumed as a "shared service" which requires internal financial transfers. What does this mean?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a traditional example. An IT group purchases a mainframe computer for $1,000,000. This mainframe is made available to various departments who are charged for it. Because the mainframe is a shared resource, it can run multiple workloads simultaneously. For the year, we see the following usage:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>30% Accounting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>40% Sales operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>30% Supply chain</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the simplest direct allocation model, the departments would pay for the portion of the mainframe that they used. But things always are more complex than that.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What if the mainframe has excess capacity? Who pays for that?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What if Sales Operations stops using the mainframe? Do Accounting and Supply Chain have to make up the loss? What if Accounting decides to stop using it because of the price increase? (In public utilities, this is known as a <a href="http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/this-is-what-the-utility-death-spiral-looks-like">death spiral.</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The mainframe requires power, floor space, and cooling. How are these incorporated into the departmental charges?</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Historically, <strong>cost accounting</strong> has been the basis for much IT financial management (see e.g. ITIL Service Strategy, <a href="#TSO2011a">[TSO2011a]</a>, p.202; <a href="#Quinlan2003">[Quinlan2003]</a>). Such approaches traditionally seek <em>full absorption</em> of unit costs; that is, each "unit" of inventory ideally represents the total cost of all its inputs: materials, labor, and overhead such as machinery and buildings.</p>

<strong>Cost accounting</strong> is defined as "the techniques for determining the costs of products, processes, projects, etc. in order to report the correct amounts on the financial statements, and assisting management in making decisions and in the planning and control of an organization  . . . For example, cost accounting is used to compute the unit cost of a manufacturer&#8217;s products in order to report the cost of inventory on its balance sheet and the cost of goods sold on its income statement. This is achieved with techniques such as the allocation of manufacturing overhead costs and through the use of process costing, operations costing, and job-order costing systems. <a href="#Accounting2016">[Accounting2016]</a>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In IT/digital service organizations, there are three basic sources of cost: "cells, atoms, and bits." That is:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>People (i.e. their time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardware</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Software</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, these are "direct" costs - costs that for example a product or project manager can see in their full amount.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another class of cost is "indirect." The IT service might be charged $300 per square foot for data center space. This provides access to rackspace, power, cooling, security, and so forth.  This charge represents the bills the Facilities organization in turn receives from power companies, mechanicals vendors, security services, and so forth - not to mention the mortgage!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the service may depend on other services. Perhaps instead of a dedicated database server, the service subscribes to a database <strong>service</strong> that gives them a high-performance relational database, but where they do not pay directly for the hardware, software, and support services the database is based on. Just to make things more complicated, the services might be external (public Cloud) or internal (private Cloud or other offerings).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Those are the major classes of cost. But how do we understand the "unit of inventory" in an IT services context? A variety of concepts can be used, depending on the service in question:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Transactions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Network ports</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Storage (e.g. gigabytes of disk)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In internal IT organizations (see <a href="#consumer-customer-sponsor">"Defining consumer, customer, and sponsor"</a>) this cost accounting is then used to transfer funds from the budgets of consuming organizations to the IT budget. Sometimes this is done via simple allocations (Marketing pays 30%, Sales pays 25%, etc) and sometimes this is done through more sophisticated approaches, such as defining unit costs for services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, the fully absorbed unit cost for a customer account transaction might be determined to be $0.25; this ideally represents the total cost of the hardware, software, and staff divided by the expected transactions. Establishing the models for such costs, and then tracking them, can be a complex undertaking, requiring correspondingly complex systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT managers have known for years that overly detailed cost accounting approaches can result in consuming large fractions of IT resources. As AT&amp;T financial manager John McAdam noted:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Utilizing an excessive amount of resources to capture data takes away resources that could be used more productively to meet other customer needs. Internal processing for IT is typically 30-40% of the workload. Excessive data capturing only adds to this overhead cost." <a href="#McAdam2003">[McAdam2003]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is also the problem that unit costing of this nature creates false expectations. Establishing an internal service pricing scheme implies that if the utilization of the service declines, so should the related billings. But if</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>the hardware, software, and staff costs are already sunk, or relatively inflexible and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the IT organization is seeking to fully recover costs</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>the per-transaction cost will simply have to increase if the number of transactions goes down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>James R. Huntzinger discusses the problem of excess capacity distorting unit costs, and states "it is an absolutely necessary element of accurate representation of the facts of production that some provisions be made for keeping the cost of wasted time and resources separate from normal costs" <a href="#Huntzinger2007">[Huntzinger2007]</a>. Approaches for doing this will be discussed below.</p>

Setting a numerical target and controlling performance against it is the foundation stone of the budget contract in today’s organization. But, as a concept, it is fundamentally flawed. It is like telling a motor racing driver to achieve an exact time for each lap . . . it cannot predict and control extraneous factors, any one of which could render the target totally meaningless. Nor does it help to build the capability to respond quickly to new situations. But, above all, <strong>it doesn’t teach people how to win</strong>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Beyond Budgeting</em> is the name of a 2003 book by Jeremy Hope and Robin Fraser. It written in part as an outcome of meetings and discussions between a number of large, mostly European firms dissatisfied with traditional budgeting approaches. Beyond Budgeting&#8217;s goals are described as:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>releasing capable people from the chains of the top-down performance contract and enabling them to use the knowledge resources of the organization to satisfy customers profitably and consistently beat the competition</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, Beyond Budgeting critiques the concept of the "budget contract." A simple "budget" is merely a "financial view of the future . . . [a] 'most likely outcome' given known information at the time . . . " A "budget contract" by comparison is intended to "delegate the accountability for achieving agreed outcomes to divisional, functional, and departmental managers." It includes concerns and mechanisms such as</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond Budgeting identifies various fallacies with this approach, including:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The idea that fixed financial targets maximize profit potential</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Financial incentives build motivation and commitment (see discussion on <a href="#motivation">[motivation]</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Annual plans direct actions that maximize market opportunities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Central resource allocation optimizes efficiency</p>

<li>
<p>Central coordination brings coherence</p>

<li>
<p>Financial reports provide relevant information for strategic decision-

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Beyond the poor outcomes that these assumptions generate, up to 20 to 30% of senior executives' time is spent on the annual budget contract. Overall, the Beyond Budgeting view is that the budget contract is</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>a relic from an earlier age. It is expensive, absorbs far too much time, adds little value, and should be replaced by a more appropriate performance management model.</em> <a href="#Hope2001">[Hope2001]</a>, p 4, emphasis added.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Readers of this textbook should at this point notice that many of the Beyond Budgeting concerns reflect an Agile/Lean perspective. The fallacies of efficiency and central coordination have been discussed throughout this book. However, if an organization&#8217;s financial authorities remain committed to these as operating principles, digital transformation will be difficult at best.</p>

A handful of companies are even exploring a venture-capital-style budgeting model.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we have discussed <a href="#2.04.01-process-project-product">previously</a>, product and project management are distinct. Product management in particular has more concern for overall business outcomes. If we take this to a logical conclusion, the product portfolio becomes a form of investment portfolio, managed not in terms of schedule and resources, but rather in terms of business results.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This implies the need for some form of internal venture funding model, to cover the initial investment in a minimum viable product. If and when this internal investment bears fruit, it may become the basis for a value stream organization, which can then serve as a vehicle for direct costs and an internal services market (see below). McKinsey reports the following case:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A large European insurance provider restructured its budgeting processes so that each product domain is assigned a share of the annual budget, to be utilized by chief product owners. (Part of the budget is also reserved for requisite maintenance costs.) Budget responsibilities have been divided into three categories: a development council consisting of business and IT managers meets monthly to make go/no-go decisions on initiatives. Chief product owners are charged with the tactical allocation of funds—making quick decisions in the case of a new business opportunity, for instance—and they meet continually to rebalance allocations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, product owners are responsible for ensuring execution of software development tasks within 40-hour work windows and for managing maintenance tasks and backlogs; these, too, are reviewed on a rolling basis. As a result of this shift in approach, the company has increased its budgeting flexibility and significantly improved market response times. <a href="#Comella2016">[Comella2016]</a></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With a rolling backlog and stable funding that decouples annual allocation from ongoing execution, the venture-funded product paradigm is likely to continue growing. A product management mindset activates a variety of useful practices, as we will discuss in the next section.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In governing for effectiveness and innovation, one technique is that of options. Related to the idea of options is parallel development.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In investing terms, purchasing an option gives one the right, but not the obligation, to purchase a stock (or other value) for a given price at a given time. Options are an important tool for investors to develop strategies to compensate for market uncertainty.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What does this have to do with developing digital products?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Product development is so uncertain that sometimes it makes sense to try several approaches at once. This in fact was how the program to develop the first atomic bomb was successfully managed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Parallel development is analogous to an options strategy. Small, sustained investments in different development "options" can optimize development payoff in certain situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taken to a logical conclusion, such an options strategy starts to resemble the portfolio management approaches of venture capitalists. Venture capitalists invest in a broad variety of opportunities, knowing that most in fact will not pan out. See discussion of <a href="#internal-venture">internal venture funding</a> as a business model.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is arguable that the venture-funded model has created different attitudes and expectations towards governance in West Coast "unicorn" culture. However, it would be dangerous to assume that this model is universally applicable. A firm is more than a collection of independent sub-organizations; this is an important line of thought in management theory, starting with Coase&#8217;s "The Nature of the Firm" <a href="#Coase1937">[Coase1937]</a>.</p>

<p><em>the cost-management system in a lean environment must be more reflective of the physical operation. It must not be confined to monetary measures but must also include nonfinancial measures, such as quality and throughput times.</em><a href="#Huntzinger2007">[Huntzinger2007]</a></p>

<p>Another useful Reinertsen concept is that of <strong>design in process</strong> or DIP. This is an explicit analog to the well-known Lean concept of <strong>work in process</strong> (WIP). Reinertsen  makes the following points  <a href="#Reinertsen1997">[Reinertsen1997]</a>,  p13:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>DIP is larger and more expensive to hold than WIP</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has much lower turn rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has much higher holding costs (e.g. due to obsolescence)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DIP&#8217;s liabilities are ignored due to weaknesses in accounting standards</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>These concerns give powerful economic incentives for managing throughput and flow, continuously re-prioritizing for maximum economic benefit and driving towards the Lean ideal of single-piece flow.</p>

<p>IT service costing has long presented additional challenges to traditional cost accounting. As IT Financial Management Association president Terry Quinlan notes, "Many factors have contributed to the difficulty of planning EDP expenditures at both application and overall levels. A major factor is the difficulty of measuring fixed and variable cost." <a href="#Quinlan2003">[Quinlan2003]</a>, p. 6.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This begs the broader question: should traditional cost accounting be the primary accounting technique used at all? Cost accounting in Lean and Agile organizations is often controversial. Lean pioneer Taiichi Ohno of Toyota thought it was a flawed approach. Huntzinger <a href="#Huntzinger2007">[Huntzinger2007]</a> identifies a variety of issues:</p>

<p>The trend in Lean Accounting has been to simplify. A guiding ideal is seen in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_accounting">Wikipedia article on Lean Accounting</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>The "ideal" for a manufacturing company is to have only two types of transactions within the production processes; the receipt of raw materials and the shipment of finished product.</em></p>

<p>Concepts such as value stream orientation, internal market economics, and service brokering all can contribute towards achieving this ideal.</p>

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
Collecting costs into traditional financial accounting categories, like labor, material, overhead, selling, distribution, and administrative, will conceal the underlying cost structure of products . . . The alternative to traditional methods . . . is the creation of an environment that moves indirect costs and allocation into direct costs.<a href="#Huntzinger2007">[Huntzinger2007]</a>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed above, Lean thinking discourages the use of any concept of overhead, sometimes disparaged as "peanut butter" costing. Rather, direct assignment of all costs to the maximum degree is encouraged, in the interest of accounting simplicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We discussed a venture-funded product model above, as an alternative to project-centric approaches. Once a product has proven its viability and becomes an operational concern, it becomes the primary vehicle for those concerns previously handled through cost accounting and chargeback. The term for a product that has reached this stage is "value stream." As Huntzinger notes, "Lean principles demand that companies align their operations around products and not processes." <a href="#Huntzinger2007">[Huntzinger2007]</a> p 19.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By combinining a value stream orientation in conjunction with organizational principles such as frugality, internal market economics, and decentralized decision-making (see e.g. <a href="#Hope2001">[Hope2001]</a> p 12), both Lean and Beyond Budgeting argue that more customer-satisfying and profitable results will ensue. The fact that the product in this case is digital (not manufactured), and the value stream centers around product development (not production) does not change the argument.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>IT has long been viewed as a "business within a business." In the internal market model, services consume other services, ad infinitum <a href="#Meyer2013">[Meyer2013]</a>. Sometimes the relationship is hierarchical (an application team consuming infrastructure services) and sometimes it is peer to peer (an application team consuming another&#8217;s services, or a network support team consuming email services, which in turn require network services.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The increasing sourcing options including various Cloud options make it more and important that internal digital services be comparable to external markets. This in turn puts constraints on traditional IT cost recovery approaches, which often result in charges with no seeming relationship to reasonable market prices.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several reasons for this. One commonly cited reason is that internal IT costs include support services, and therefore cannot fairly be compared to simple retail prices (e.g. for a computer as a good.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another, more insidious reason is the rolling in of unrelated IT overhead to product prices. We have quoted James Huntzinger&#8217;s work above in various places on this topic. Dean Meyer has elaborated this topic in greater depth from an IT financial management perspective, calling for some organzational "goods" to be funded as either Ventures (similar to above discussion) or "subsidies" (for enterprise-wide benefits such as technical standardization) <a href="#Meyer2013">[Meyer2013]</a>, p.92.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed above, a particularly challenging form of IT overhead is excess capacity. The saying "the first person on the bus has to buy the bus" is often used in IT shared services, but is problematic. A new, venture-funded startup cannot operate this way - expecting the first few customers to fully fund the investment! Nor can this work in an internal market, unless heavy handed political pressure is brought to bear. This is where internal venture funding is required.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meyer presents a sophisticated framework for understanding and managing an internal market of digital services. This is not a simple undertaking; for example, correctly setting service prices can be surprisingly complex.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_service_brokerage">Service brokerage</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, there is the idea that digital or IT services should be aggregated and "brokered" by some party (perhaps the descendant of a traditional IT organization). In partcular, this helps with capacity management, which can be a troublesome source of internal pricing distortions. This has been seen not only in IT services, but in Lean attention to manufacturing; when unused capacity is figured into product cost accounting, distortions occur <a href="#Huntzinger2007">[Huntzinger2007]</a>, chapter 7, "Church and Excess Capacity."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applying Meyer&#8217;s principles, excess capacity would be identified as a Subsidy or a Venture as a distinct line item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But Cloud services can assist even further. Excess capacity often results from the available quantities in the market - e.g., one purchases hardware in large-grained capital units. But more flexibly priced, expensed compute on demand services are available, it is feasible to allocate and de-allocate capacity on demand, eliminating the need for accounting for excess capacity.</p>

<h5 id="_the_two_dimensions_of_demand_management">The two dimensions of demand management</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management is our first major specialization of <a href="#2.05.00-work-management">Chapter 5</a>'s general concept of "work management." (We will turn to process management in the next chapter.) In the interest of keeping project management firmly in context, consider the following two-dimensional analysis:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

<p>You should spend some time considering the graphic, which provides a unique way of understanding the work you are now experiencing as a "team of teams" or "manager of managers" in an IT-dependent environment of increasing size and complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve come a long ways from the last section&#8217;s insistence that "it&#8217;s all just work." But there still is an essential truth there. Regardless of the abstract label we put on a given activity, it represents some set of tasks or objectives that real people are going to take time to perform, and expect to be compensated for. Retaining a clear realization of this is essential to maintaining truly business-aligned IT management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s consider the various forms that demand may take. While this may not be project management per se, it&#8217;s essential to putting project management in a broader context. This will also help you develop a deeper understanding of an <strong>architecture of IT management</strong>, a topic the author has explored in other works <a href="#Betz2011">[Betz2011]</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bubbles represent a "space" where one is likely to find that kind of work. As indicated by the central diagonal, it reflects an assumption that larger amounts of work are more likely to be planned further in advance. However, this is not always true. A large, unwelcome amount of required work that shows up with no planning is probably a disaster. Desired work (in the form of aggregate transactional demand) may also spike unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Some forms of work may lead to other forms of work. For example, Projects may manifest as Stories, Releases, and Changes.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve discussed <a href="#2.05.00-work-management">work management</a>, which is an important precursor of process management. Work management is less formalized; a wide variety of activities are handled through flexible <a href="#2.05.02-kanban">Kanban</a>-style boards or "card walls" based on the simplest "process" of:</p>

<p>And when tasks become more routine and specialized, formal process management starts to emerge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Processes are how we ensure consistency, repeatability, and quality. You get expected treatment at banks, coffee shops, and dentists because they follow processes. IT systems often enable processes – a mortgage origination system is based on IT software that enforces a consistent process. IT management itself follows certain processes, for all the same reasons as above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Process, in terms of "business process," has been a topic of study and professional development for many years. Pioneering Business Process Management (BPM) authors such as Michael Hammer <a href="#Hammer1993">[Hammer1993]</a> and Geary Rummler <a href="#Rummler1995">[Rummler1995]</a> have had an immense impact on business operations. Toyota considers a clear process vision, or "target condition," to be the most fundamental objective in improving operations (<a href="#Rother2010">[Rother2010]</a>, chapters 5-6).  Designing processes, improving them, and using them to improve overall performance is an ongoing activity in most, if not all organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, process can cause problems. Processes imply <a href="#queuing">queues</a>, and in digital and other product development-based organizations, this means invisible work in process. For every employee you hire who expects you to have processes, another will have bad process experiences at previous employers. Nevertheless, process remains an important tool in your toolkit for organization design.</p>

<p>Process is a broad concept used throughout business operations. <strong>The coverage here is primarily about process as applied to the digital organization.</strong> There is a bit of a recursive paradox here; in part, we are talking about the <strong>process by which business processes are analyzed and automated</strong>. By definition, this overall "process" (you could call it a <strong>meta</strong>-process) cannot be made too prescriptive or predictable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also introduce process in terms of our <a href="#0.01-emergence">emergence model</a>, and therefore focus on the concerns and dynamics that may cause you to notice the concept, and your need for it.</p>

<p>Process management starts with the fundamental capability for coordinated <a href="#2.05.00-work-management">work management</a>, and refines it much further.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our company, work has been specializing. A simple card-based kanban approach is no longer sufficient. We are finding that some work is repetitive, and we need to remember to do certain things in certain orders. For example, a new Human Resources (HR) manager was hired. The HR manager decided that a sticky note of "hire someone new for us" was not sufficient. As she pointed out to the team, hiring needed to follow a defined sequence of tasks:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Establishing the need and purpose for the position</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Soliciting candidates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Filtering the candidates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selecting a final choice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Registering that new employee in the payroll system</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting the new employee set up with benefits providers (insurance, retirement, etc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Getting the new employee working space, equipment, and access to systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Training the new employee in organizational policies, as well as any position-specific orientation</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The sales, marketing, and finance teams have similarly been developing ordered lists of tasks that are consistently executed as end to end sequences. And even in the core digital development and operations teams, they are finding that some tasks are repetitive and need documentation so they are performed consistently.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More broadly, your entire digital product pipeline is sometimes called a "process." From initial feature idea through production, you seek a consistent means for identifying and implementing valuable functionality. Sometimes this work requires intensive, iterative collaboration and is unpredictable (e.g. developing a user interface); sometimes, the work is more repeatable (e.g. packaging and releasing tested functionality).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, some team members are cautious of the word "process". The term "process police" comes up in an unhappy way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"Are we going to have auditors tracking whether we filled out all our forms correctly?," one asks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"We used to get these consultants in at my old company and they would leave piles of 3 ring binders on the shelf that no one ever looked at," another person says.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"I can&#8217;t write code according to someone&#8217;s recipe!," a third says with some passion, and to general agreement from the developers in the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The irony is that digital products are based on process automation. The idea that certain tasks can be done repeatably and at scale through digitization is fundamental to all use of computers. The digital service <strong>is</strong> fundamentally an automated process, one that can be intricate and complicated. That&#8217;s what computers do. But process management also spans human activities, and that&#8217;s where things get more complex.</p>

<p>So, the kanban board has started to elaborate. We&#8217;re seeing more and more work that needs to follow a sequence, or checklist&#8230;&#8203; Wait, didn&#8217;t we see that in the chapter on Project Management?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We discussed task ordering in Chapter 8. However, projects are not usually seen as repeatable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It all starts with just "work." The following diagram might help:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management adds concerns of task ordering and resource management, for projects typically executed on a one-time basis.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Process management is also concerned with ordering, but less so with the resource load (more on this below), and instead is concerned with repeatability and ongoing improvement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Process management is when we need to start managing</p>

<p>and even common tooling to support multiple processes.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Project management and process management interact in 2 primary ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Projects often are used to create and deploy processes. A large system implementation (e.g. of a Enterprise Resource Planning module such as Human Resource Management) will often be responsible for process implementation including training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As environments mature, product and/or project teams require process support.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Richardson notes in <em>Project Management Theory and Practice</em>, "there are many organizational processes that are needed to optimally support a successful project." <a href="#Richardson2010">[Richardson2010]</a> For example, the project may require predictable contractor hiring, or infrastructure provisioning, or security reviews. The same is true for product teams that may not be using a "project" concept to manage their work. To the extent these are managed as repeatable, optimized processes, risk is reduced.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_process_and_organization">Process and organization</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Processes are much more than repeatable activities. Many leading thinkers (such as Michael Porter, quoted at the start of this chapter section) see organizations primarily as sets of interacting processes, supporting fundamental end to end value chains or value streams. We will talk more about this in the next chapter section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The concept of process is often contrasted with that of function or organization. We have seen in previous chapters how product development and project management must drive results across organizational boundaries. Process management has a similar challenge; its goal is to drive <strong>repeatable</strong> results across organizational boundaries.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we know from our discussion of <a href="#2.04.00-product-mgmt">Product Management</a>, developing new products is not a particularly repeatable process. The Agile movement in some ways arose in opposition to attempts to apply process concepts of "repeatability" to developing software. These concerns remain.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this book is not only about digital R&amp;D processes. It is also about a spectrum of operations and effort that spans from the unique to the highly repeatable. There is an interesting middle ground, of processes that are at least semi-repeatable. Examples often found in the large digital organization include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assessing, approving, and completing changes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>End user equipment provisioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resolving incidents and answering user inquiries</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Troubleshooting problems</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And many others. We will talk about a wide variety of such processes in the chapter section on process frameworks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is important to realize, however, that just as the traditional IT project is under pressure, there are similar challenges for the traditional IT process. Continuous deployment techniques are eroding the need for formal change management. Consumerization is challenging traditional internal IT provisioning practices. And self-service help desks are eliminating some traditional support activities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Nevertheless, any rumors of an "end to process" are probably greatly exaggerated. There will likely always be complex combinations of automated, semi-automated, and manual activity in digital organizations. Some of this activity will be repeatable enough that the "process" construct will be applied to it. Measurability remains a concern; the Lean philosophy underpinning much Agile thought emphasizes this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore useful to understand more fundamentally what processes are, how they operate, and how they are managed and improved.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_process_as_skill">Process as skill</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we discussed at the beginning of this chapter, sometimes new employees come in expecting that you are following certain processes. This is in part because "process" experience can be an important part of an employee&#8217;s career background. A skilled HR manager may consider their experience with large-scale enterprise hiring processes to be a major part of their qualifications for a position in your company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This applies to both "business" and "IT" processes. In fact, in the digital world, there is no real difference. Digital processes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Initiate new systems, from idea to construction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publicize and grant access to the new systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capture revenue from the systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support people in their interactions with the systems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix the systems when they break</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the systems based on stakeholder feedback</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s not clear which of these are "IT" versus "business" processes. But they are definitely processes. Some of them are more predictable, some less so, but they all represent some form of ordered work that is repeatable to some degree. And to some extent, you are seeking people with experience defined at least in part by their exposure to processes.</p>

<h5 id="_measuring_process">Measuring process</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important reasons for repeatable processes is so that they can be measured and understood. Repeatable processes are measured in terms of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effort</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality</p>

<li>
<p>Variation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outcomes</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>at the most general level, and of course all of those measurements must be defined much more specifically depending on the process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Measurement is an essential aspect of process management, but must be carefully designed. Measuring process can have unforeseen results. Process participants will behave according to how the process is measured. If a help desk operator is measured and rated on how many calls they process an hour, the quality of those interactions may suffer. It is critical that any process "key performance indicator" be understood in terms of the highest possible business objectives. Is the objective truly to process as many calls as possible? Or is it to satisfy the customer so they need not turn to other channels to get their answers?

<h5 id="_bpm_fundamentals">BPM fundamentals</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve discussed some of the factors leading to the need for process management, but we haven&#8217;t yet come to grips with what it <strong>is</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Process management is grounded in business fundamentals. Businesses convert inputs (capital, materials, staff talent) into valuable outputs and generate valuable surplus (margin) for shareholders and other stakeholders.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This act of <strong>conversion</strong> is a <strong>process</strong>. The overall process has been described by Michael Porter as a "value chain."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="value-chain"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.09-valCh.png" alt="3.09 valCh">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Value Chain similar to <a href="#Porter1998">[Porter1998]</a>.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the progression along the bottom: first, raw materials are acquired, then manufactured, then distributed at which point they are marketed and sold, and ultimately serviced. Porter termed this set of activities "Primary."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The upper half represents what Porter termed "support." Supporting activities represent necessary, but not value adding, functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many criticisms of the Porter value chain. Without research and development, there is no product, so why is it considered a support activity (and confusingly named just "Technology Development")? Surely, marketing and sales help drive demand for the product, especially with manufacturing lead times shrinking, so why do they appear so late in the game?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Overall, the model represents a manufacturing-centric world where customers were happy to buy what was on offer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this does not change the fact that most value has some rough ordering to it (it is difficult to sell and service a product before you invent and produce it), and the idea that some activities are primary while others are supporting also is useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The value chain as a whole is high level. We can think of a large company in these terms, but we cannot easily manage it this way. Value chains therefore are the ultimate "process" but in order for process to have value, we need to take it down a level or two.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do this, we should clarify some terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="process-function"></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_process_and_related_terms">Process and related terms</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following terms often appear in discussions of process:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Function</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capability</p>
</li>
<li>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will use the following definitions:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="process-def"></a>
A <strong>process</strong> is an ordered, countable set of activities; an event-driven, value-adding sequence that can be measured and improved. The following terms often are used to describe processes or their components:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Value chain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Value stream</p>

<p>Task</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Processes <strong>cross</strong> functions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Visually, processes are often represented with chevrons, like Porter&#8217;s original value chain:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.09-chevrons.png" alt="3.09 chevrons">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no industry standard that definitely lists the concepts above in terms of granularity. Is a "task" larger or smaller than a "procedure?" We will not discuss these much. However, between the high level concept of "value chain" and the concepts of "process" and "activity," is the concept of "<strong>value stream</strong>."  This is a key concept from the Lean community, and is a relatively higher-level concept (a value chain decomposes into value streams, according to some.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An example of a value stream could be the complete manufacturing and sales process for one product family. Because they are more specific, value streams are more measurable and countable. Optimizing them in terms of eliminating wasted time, effort and inventory is an objective of Lean thinking. See <em>Learning to See</em> by Rother and Shook <a href="#Rother2003">[Rother2003]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Functions</strong> are unordered, steady state domains of activity. An organizational chart often can be based on various functions. Functions also often imply hierarchy. They are more difficult to measure or improve; usually, improving a function means improving some process it owns or performs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Functions, especially when they are closely aligned to an organizational structure, may be represented as a hierarchy:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.09-hier.png" alt="3.09 hier">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They may also be represented as nested shapes:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.09-hier-nested.png" alt="3.09 hier nested">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However - and this is an important point - functions do <strong>not</strong> necessarily need to reflect the organizational chart. Often, they are used as a "logical" construct, to help with organizational design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What do we mean by this?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose two companies merge. They may leave their organizational charts untouched for a time, because they do not know what parts of each company should merge together. They have two sets of developers, two sets of sales staff, and so on. They do not feel that either company&#8217;s organizational structure is a good basis for the new, larger company.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To solve this, they might create a logical functional hierarchy, with no-one&#8217;s name on any part. Where their actual organization structure (temporarily) has duplication, the logical hierarchy does not. They then start to populate it with individuals and teams from the previous companies and in this way develop a new organizational structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.09-hier2.png" alt="3.09 hier2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of thinking can help the organization evolve over time. If different teams find themselves performing similar activities, a functional analysis might indicate a new organizational structure.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the following two terms are also unordered, but have different connotations from function:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service (sometimes)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>capability</strong> is a generic term for a capacity or potential.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>service</strong> is a transactional act of value, simultaneously produced and delivered (more on this later).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, the concept of <strong>practice</strong> is the least formalized of the concepts. It represents a loose, conceptual area that may represent a community of common interest (for example, a Java community of practice). It&#8217;s not usually measured or tracked for improvement. Some topics may start as a practice and formalize into a function, for example Capacity management.</p>

<p>If a wired connection is needed, Network Management may be required to "turn  on" a port in the employee&#8217;s location.</p>

<p>This is a deliberately older, traditional workflow. Modern organizations may accelerate things:</p>

<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>HR enters a record</p>

<li>
<p>All employees use common "hoteling" space, so the major Facilities concern is whether the space can accommodate the peak # of employees seen (e.g. at 10 AM on a Wednesday)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipment is either BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) or is ordered from an authorized vendor and drop-shipped directly to the employee</p>

<p>Networking in modern organizations is almost all wireless, but the employee still requires the appropriate credentials, likely provided by security. As with facilities, Networking&#8217;s concerns now move to questions of capacity and availability of the overall infrastructure.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice however that even in the modern scenario, we have an end to end, repeatable value flow that crosses distinct domains of concern. The employee is not productive until all these steps are taken. Since the employee starts drawing payroll on hire, there is a substantial cost of delay for this entire process. A week&#8217;s unproductive time could amount to $10,000 or more, wasted.</p>
</div>

<p>Such delays can easily happen when functional areas are focused just on their responsibility, and no one is concerned for the overall process. This is why Rummler and Brache chose the title <em>Improving Performance: How to Manage the White Space on the Organization Chart</em> for their groundbreaking book on business process. The "white space" they are talking about is the spaces between the functions, also termed "silos" or "towers:"</p>

<p>You may notice that the cross functional process is named with an active verb, "Onboard." This is in contrast to the functional silos, which end in "management." This is deliberate and a well-established BPM best practice. "Onboard employee" is event-driven and countable; it has a clear beginning and end and therefore can be measured in various ways. "Human Resource Management", on the other hand, has no beginning or end; it is a steady-state set of organizational concerns and resources.</p>

<p>The idea that a box can represent an activity or objective, and can be linked in sequence to other boxes though lines, has been around since at least the 1920s. Many different visual languages have been developed over the years for various purposes. Some are highly formalized, others less so. The following definitions may help:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>modeling language</strong> is a set of concepts and definitions that describes a given problem space. Modeling languages can be formalized to different degrees of precision.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>notation</strong> is a specific set of visual symbols mapped onto a modeling language. One modeling language might have different notations; for example, Data Flow Diagrams have two notations but both communicate essentially the same language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <strong>model</strong> is a specific usage of a modeling language and notation to communicate some idea about a system. It may also be a verb, e.g. "I am going to <strong>model</strong> the system."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many different forms of modeling, extending far beyond IT and digital management. Scientists develop models of physical processes; financial analysts develop models of the stock market. Different aspects of a digital system might be modeled at different times:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The process it is automating might be modeled as part of analysis</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its data structures might be modeled somewhat later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the system is running under load, capacity analysts might model its consumption of compute and network resources and develop projections for when additional capacity might be needed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Process modeling is therefore only a subset, but an important one. Process analysis is one of most important activities in the broader area of business analysis and architecture, which in turn are key to <a href="#2.04.00-product-mgmt">product management</a> in general (as we briefly mentioned in Chapter 4).</p>

<p><strong>Inputs</strong> include the information or event stimulus that initiates the activity. They also include resources that will be consumed in the course of the activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Guides</strong> govern the process, setting constraints and expectations (e.g. current HR policies). They are not consumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Outputs</strong> include the final, value-added outcome of the activity, and also serve as a signal for downstream activities to commence.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Enablers</strong> support the process, without being immediately consumed. Examples include infrastructure and facilities support.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IGOE approach is seen in the classic IDEF0 standard (the terms used there were Inputs, Controls, Outputs, Mechanisms). This is a form of <strong>functional modeling</strong> which is <strong>not</strong> event driven but rather is used to scope higher level interactions between areas.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original intent of the IDEF0 standard was for a multi-level, decomposition approach, A high level scope would be elaborated thus:</p>

<p>However, there is not a clear sense of the events, since the primary objects are still the functions. There also is the temptation to insert extraneous information, as indicated in the line between Facilities Management and IT Asset Management labeled "Provides space for ??".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is true that Facilities Management does provide space for the IT Asset Management Team (in fact, all of these functions provide services to each other), but to draw this would result in a "spaghetti" diagram with several dozen lines and not much explanatory power.</p>

<p>However, we encounter a complication. In order to describe this process accurately, we should note that some people do not have space assigned, if they are primarily telecommuting and/or working in "hoteling" space. We want to show a decision point, which in many notations is represented by a diamond.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/3.09-ordering4.png" alt="3.09 ordering4">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, this ordering is taking too long, because people are waiting for space to be assigned before doing anything else. This is a well understood problem; processes can branch and run in parallel (you may well be writing code that works this way; human processes also do this). In UML, the term is "fork" for when processes diverge to run in parallel, and "join" when they must again synchronize for the next activity to continue:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the above diagram, we see that 3 activities (including the decision point) can commence independently when the employee is hired, but network access requires that the employee have both an entry in the enterprise directory, as well as their hardware supplied. The entire process is complete when their space, equipment, and access needs have been met.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_swimlanes">Swimlanes</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We made much of the fact that processes cross functions, and yet with our final diagram we have lost our view of this fact. We can re-introduce the functional boundaries through the use of swimlanes (pioneered by Rummler in <a href="#Rummler1995">[Rummler1995]</a>):</p>

<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding the swimlanes helps us understand the cross-functional handoffs, and also where certain activities will remain within the scope of one function. Another interesting, finer point is the question of the synch points. Observe the synch point in the Network Management swimlane. Its presence implies that the Network Management function must confirm that the employee has equipment and a directory in the enterprise directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may notice that this diagram has been "rotated." The diagram was becoming too long if drawn left to right. UML Activity Diagrams frequently use a top-to-bottom approach. The meaning of the diagram is not changed.</p>

<p>There are endless nuances and debates about BPM notations, methodology, and philosophy. Don&#8217;t get caught up in it.

History is important. You may think your career is far removed from the early days of the industrial revolution, but the influence of early management thinkers such as Frederick Taylor remains.

<p>The history of continuous improvement is intertwined with the history of 20th century business itself. Before the industrial revolution, goods and services were produced primarily by local farmers, artisans, and merchants. Techniques were jealously guarded, not shared. A given blacksmith might have two or three workers, who might all forge a pan or a sword in a different way. The term "productivity" itself was unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then the Industrial Revolution happened.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As steam and electric power increased the productivity of industry, requiring greater sums of capital to fund, a search for improvements began. Blacksmith shops (and other craft producers such as grain millers and weavers) began to consolidate into larger organizations, and technology became more complex and dangerous. It started to become clear that allowing each worker to perform the work as they preferred was not feasible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Enter the scientific method. Thinkers such as Frederick Taylor and Frank and Lillian Gilbreth (of "Cheaper by the Dozen" fame) started applying careful techniques of measurement and comparison, in search of the "one best way" to dig ditches or assemble vehicles. An entire profession of industrial engineering was established, along with the formal study of business management itself.</p>

<h5 id="_frederick_taylor_and_efficiency">Frederick Taylor and efficiency</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Frederick Taylor (1856-1915)  was a mechanical engineer and one of the first industrial engineers. In 1911, he wrote <em>Principles of Scientific Management</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of Taylor&#8217;s primary contributions to management thinking was a systematic approach to efficiency. To understand this, let&#8217;s consider some fundamentals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Human beings engage in repetitive activities. These activities consume inputs and produce outputs. It is often possible to compare the outputs against the inputs, numerically, and understand how "productive" the process is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, suppose you have two factories producing identical kitchen utensils (pizza cutters, say).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If one factory can produce 50,000 pizza cutters for $2,000, while the other requires $5,000, the first factory is more productive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assume for a moment that the workers are all earning the same across each factory. There is possibly a "process" problem. The first factory is more <em>efficient</em> than the second; it can produce more given the same set of inputs. Why?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many possible reasons. Perhaps the second factory is poorly laid out and the work in progress must be moved too many times in order for workers to perform their tasks. Perhaps the workers are using tools that require more manual steps. Understanding the differences between the two factories, and recommending the "best way," is what Taylor pioneered, and what industrial engineers do to this day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Peter Drucker, one of the most influential management thinkers, says of Frederick Taylor:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The application of knowledge to work explosively increased productivity. For hundreds of years there had been no increase in the ability of workers to turn out goods or to move goods . . . But within a few years after Taylor began to apply knowledge to work, productivity began to rise at a rate of 3.5 to 4 percent compound a year—which means doubling every eighteen years or so. Since Taylor began, productivity has increased some fiftyfold in all advanced countries. On this unprecedented expansion rest all the increases in both standard of living and quality of life in the developed countries. <a href="#Drucker1993">[Drucker1993]</a>, pp.37-38.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_w_e_deming_and_variation">W.E. Deming and variation</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The quest for effiency leads to the long-standing management interest in variability and variation. What do we mean by this?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you expect a process to take 5 days, what do you make of occurrences when it takes 7 days? 4 days? If you expect a manufacturing process to yield 98% usable product, what do you do when it falls to 97%? 92%?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In highly repeatable manufacturing processes, statistical techniques can be applied. Analyzing such "variation" has been a part of management for decades, and is an important part of disciplines such as Six Sigma. This is why Six Sigma is of such interest to manufacturing firms.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>\W. Edwards Deming (1900-1993) is noted for (among many other things) his understanding of variation and organizational responses to it. Understanding variation is one of the major parts of his "System of Profound Knowledge." He emphasizes the need to distinguish special causes from  common causes of variation; special causes are those requiring management attention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deming in particular was an advocate of the control chart, a technique to understand whether a process was within statistical control:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, using techniques of this nature makes certain critical assumptions about the nature of the process. Understanding variation and when to manage it requires care. These techniques were defined to understand <strong>physical</strong> processes that in general follow <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distributions</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you are working at a large manufacturer, in their IT organization, and you see the a metric of "variance from project plan." The idea is that your actual project time, scope and resources should be the same, or close to, what you planned. In practice, this tends to become a discussion about time, as resources and scope are often fixed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The assumption is that, for your project tasks, you should be able to estimate to a meaningful degree of accuracy. Your estimates are equally likely to be too low, or too high. Furthermore, it should be somehow possible to improve the accuracy of your estimates. Your annual review depends on this, in fact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The problem is that neither of these are true. Despite heroic efforts, you cannot improve your estimation. In process control jargon, there are too many causes of variation for "best practices" to emerge. Project tasks remain unpredictable, and the variability does not follow a normal distribution. Very few tasks get finished earlier than you estimated, and there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail">long tail</a> to the right, of tasks that take 2x, 3x or 10x longer than estimated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, applying statistical process control to variable, creative product development processes is inappropriate. For software development, Steven Kan states: "Many assumptions that underlie control charts are not being met in software data. Perhaps the most critical one is that data variation is from homogeneous sources of variation." That is, the causes of variation are knowable and can be addressed. This is in general not true of development work. <a href="#Kan2003">[Kan2003]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Deming (along with Juran) is also known for "continuous improvement" as a cycle, e.g. "Plan/Do/Check/Act." Such cycles are akin to the scientific method, as they essentially engage in the ongoing development and testing of hypotheses, and the implementation of validated learning. We have touched on similar cycles in our discussions of <a href="#lean-startup">Lean Startup</a> and <a href="#Toyota-Kata">Toyota Kata</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Discussions of efficiency usually focus on productivity given a certain set of inputs. Time can be one of those inputs. Everything else being equal, a company that can produce the pizza cutters more quickly is also viewed as more efficient. Customers may pay a premium for early delivery, and may penalize late delivery; such charges typically would be some percentage (say plus or minus 20%) of the final price of the finished goods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the question of time becomes a game-changer in the "process" of new product development. As we have discussed previously: Starting with a series of influential articles starting in the early 1980s, Don Reinertsen developed the idea of "cost of delay" for product development (<a href="#Reinertsen1997">[Reinertsen1997]</a>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where the cost of a delayed product shipment might be some percentage, the cost of delay for a delayed product could be much more substantial. For example, if a new product launch misses a key trade show where competitors will be presenting similar innovations, the cost to the company might be millions of dollars of lost revenue - many times the product development investment. (Perhaps even orders of magnitude larger.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is not really a question of "efficiency;" of comparing inputs to outputs and looking for a few percentage points improvement. It is more a matter of effectiveness; of the company&#8217;s ability to execute on complex knowledge work.</p>

<p>Ken Schwaber, inventor of the Scrum methodology (along with Jeff Sutherland), like many other software engineers in the 1990s, experienced discomfort with the process control approach at the time. Mainstream software development processes sought to make software development predictable and repeatable in the sense of a defined process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As Schwaber discusses (<a href="#Schwaber2002">[Schwaber2002]</a>, pp. 24-25), defined processes are completely understood, which is not the case with creative processes. Highly automated industrial processes run predictably, with consistent results. By contrast, complex processes that are not understood require the <strong>empirical model.</strong></p>

<p>Empirical process control relies on frequent inspection and adaptation. After exposure to Dupont process theory experts who clarified the difference between defined and empirical process control, Schwaber went on to develop the influential Scrum methodology. As he notes:</p>

<p><em>During my visit to DuPont . . . I realized why [software development] was in such trouble and had such a poor reputation. We were wasting our time trying to control our work by thinking we had an assembly line when the only proper control was frequent and first-hand inspection, followed by immediate adjustments.</em> <a href="#Schwaber2002">[Schwaber2002]</a>, p. 25.</p>

<p>So, what is a "framework?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The term "framework," in the context of business process, is used for comprehensive and systematic representations of a major business area&#8217;s activities. In general, an industry framework is a structured artifact that seeks to articulate a professional consensus regarding a domain of practice. The intent is usually that the guidance be mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive within the domain, so that persons knowledgeable in the framework have a broad understanding of domain concerns.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first goal of any framework, for a given conceptual space, is to provide a "map" of its components and their relationships. Doing this serves a variety of goals:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Develop and support professional consensus on the business area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support training and orientation of professionals new to the area (or its finer points)</p>

<li>
<p>Support governance and control activities related to the area (more on this in Chapter 10)</p>

<h5 id="_an_overview_of_the_major_frameworks">An overview of the major frameworks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many frameworks have emerged in the IT space, with broader and narrower domains of concern. Some are owned by non-profit standards bodies; others are commercial. We will focus on five in this book. In roughly chronological order, they are:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>CMMI (Capability Maturity Model-Integrated)</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a id="CMMI"></a></p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_cmmi">CMMI</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Capability Maturity Model was originally published by Watts Humphrey in 1989 in the book <em>Managing the Software Process</em> <a href="#Humphrey1989">[Humphrey1989]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CMM was later taken on by the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University, and is now managed by the CMMI Institute, which was acquired in 2016 by  ISACA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CMM has had considerable influence on software development and IT management more generally. It popularized the idea that process management tends to evolve in the same way across organizations, following a "staged" model:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stage 1: Initial</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stage 2: Repeatable</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stage 3: Defined</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stage 4: Managed</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stage 5: Optimizing</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(These are Humphrey&#8217;s original levels. There are some differences with the current CMMI, but the concept is the same.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These ideas can be seen reflected in later guidance such as COBIT and ITIL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within this overall framework of maturation, CMMI currently calls for 22 process areas:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Causal Analysis and Resolution (CAR)</p>

<p><a id="ITIL"></a></p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_itil">ITIL</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>About the same time as the CMM&#8217;s initial creation and transition to the Software Engineering Institute, the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency of the United Kingdom recognized that IT practices were becoming fragmented. In response, a multi-volume set of guidance known as the IT Infrastructure Library was created. A 2nd edition consolidated and updated this guidance, and achieved worldwide acceptance as a de facto standard for IT management. The term "service" was inserted, i.e. "IT Service Management" but the distinction between the ITSM term and simple "IT Management" has always been somewhat unclear.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Due to the particular structure of UK government publications, ITIL has never covered project management or the SDLC per se, or analysis, architecture and design.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>ITIL is currently published via the Axelos commercial joint venture between the UK government and Capita Group. It is now in its 4th major edition (2011). While often considered an “operational” framework, ITIL spans the lifecycle of IT services and systems; the current volumes reflect a lifecycle:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Service Strategy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Transition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Continual Service Improvement</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within these volumes, ITIL defines a number of activities, functions, and what it calls processes (more on this below). These definitions have helped stabilize industry practice and provided a basis for industry training and certification of individuals.</p>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_the_problem_of_statistical_process_control">The problem of statistical process control</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>CMM author Watts Humphrey&#8217;s original vision was to apply full statistical process control to the software process. As he stated at the time:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Dr. W. E. Deming, in his work with the Japanese after World War II, applied the concepts of statistical process control to many of their industries. While there are important differences, these concepts are just as applicable to software as they are to producing consumer goods like cameras, television sets, or auto mobiles.</em> (<a href="#Humphrey1989">[Humphrey1989]</a>, p. 3)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The overall CMM/CMMI idea (in the well-known staged model) is that a process cannot be improved and optimized until it is fully under control. Perhaps well-defined industrial processes should not be optimized until they are fully "managed." However, as we discussed in the previous section,  process control theorists see creative, knowledge-intensive processes as requiring <a href="#empirical-process-control">empirical control</a>. SPC applied to software has therefore been criticized as inappropriate <a href="#Racynski2008">[Racynski2008]</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In CMM terms, empirical process control starts by measuring and immediately optimizing (adjusting). To restate the Martin Fowler quote from the last section: "a process can still be controlled even if it can&#8217;t be defined."<a href="#Schwaber2002">[Schwaber2002]</a> They need not&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;and <strong>cannot</strong>&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;be fully defined. One of the most questionable aspects of CMMI therefore, is its implication that process optimization is <em>something only done at the highest levels of maturity</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>In short, the CMMI staged model encourages the thought that process improvement (optimization) only  is possible at Level 5. Many companies implementing CMMI stages however will pragmatically say "Maybe we only need to get to level 3." This implies that they define and manage their processes, but never improve them.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This runs against much current thinking and practice, especially that deriving from Lean philosophy, in which processes are seen as always under improvement. (See discussion of <a href="#Toyota-Kata">Toyota Kata</a>.) All definition, measurement, and control must serve that end.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CMMI has evolved since Humphrey&#8217;s initial vision, but between its  mis-applicaton of statistical process control, and the idea that that process optimization is only relevant at the highest maturity, it is (in the view of this author) badly out of step with current digital trends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other frameworks do not embrace statistical process control to the same extent as the CMMI. PMBOK suggests that "control charts may also be used to monitor cost and schedule variances, volume, and frequency of scope changes, or other management results to help determine if the project management processes are in control" (<a href="#PMI2013">[PMI2013]</a>, Kindle Locations 4108-4109). This also contradicts the insights of empirical process control, unless the project were also a fully defined process&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;unlikely from a process control perspective.</p>

<p>The digital delivery system at scale is a complex socio-technical system, including people, process, and technology. Frameworks help in understanding it, by breaking it down into component parts in various ways. This is all well and good, but the danger of <strong>reductionism</strong> emerges.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A reductionist view implies that a system is nothing but the sum of its parts. Therefore, if each of the parts is attended to, the system will also function well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can lead to a compulsive desire to do "all" of a framework. If ITIL calls for 25 processes, then a large, mature organization by definition should be good at all of them. But the 25 processes (and dozens more sub-processes and activities) called for by ITIL, or the 32 called for by COBIT, are somewhat arbitrary divisions. They overlap with each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, there are many digital organizations that do not use the full ITIL or COBIT process portfolio and yet deliver value as well as organizations that do use ITIL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This temptation for local, process-level optimization runs counter to core principles of Lean and Systems Thinking. Many management thinkers, including W.E. Deming, Eli Goldratt, and others have emphasized the dangers of local optimization, and the need for taking a systems view.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As this book&#8217;s structure suggests, delivering IT value requires different approaches at different scales. There is recognition of this among framework practitioners; however, the frameworks themselves provide insufficient guidance on how they scale up and down.</p>

<h6 id="_lack_of_execution_model">Lack of execution model</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is also questionable whether even the largest actual IT organizations on the planet could fully implement the frameworks. Specifying too many interacting processes has its own complications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider: Both ITIL and COBIT devote considerable time to documenting possible process inputs and outputs. As a part of every process definition, ITIL has a section entitled "Triggers, inputs, outputs, and interfaces." The Service Level Management Process (<a href="#TSO2011b">[TSO2011b]</a>, pp 120-122) for example, lists:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>7 triggers (e.g. "service breaches")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 inputs (e.g. "customer feedback")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10 outputs (e.g. "reports on OLAs")</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7 interfaces (e.g. "Supplier management")</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>COBIT similarly details process inputs and outputs. In the Enabling Processes guidance, each management practice suggests inputs and outputs. For example, the APO08 process "Manage Relationships" has an activity of "Provide input to the continual improvement of services," with</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>6 inputs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 outputs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But processes do not run themselves. These process inputs and outputs require staff attention. They often imply <a href="#queuing">queues</a> and therefore Work in Process, often invisible. They impose demand on the system and each handoff represents transactional friction. Some handoffs may be implemented within the context of an IT management suite; others may require procedural standards, which themselves need to be created and maintained. The industry currently lacks understanding of how feasible such fully elaborated frameworks are, in terms of the time, effort, and organizational structure they imply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have discussed the issue of overburden previously. Too many organizations have contending execution models, where projects, processes, and miscellaneous work all compete for people&#8217;s attention. In such environments, the overburden and wasteful <a href="#multi-tasking">multi-tasking</a> can reach crisis levels. With ITIL in particular, because it does not cover project management or architecture, we have a very large quantity of potential process interactions that is nevertheless incomplete.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process handoffs also imply that artifacts (documents of various sorts, models, software, etc.) are being created and transferred in between teams, or at least between roles on the same team with some degree of formality.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Primary artifacts are executable software and any additional content intended directly for value delivery. Secondary artifacts are anything else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An examination of the ITIL and COBIT process interactions shows that many of the artifacts are secondary concepts such as "plans," "designs," or "reports:"</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Design specifications (high level and detailed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Operation and use plan</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Action plans</p>

<li>

</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and so on. (Note that actually executable artifacts are not included here.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, artifacts do not create themselves. Hundreds of artifacts are implied in the process frameworks. Every artifact implies:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some template or known technique for performing it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People trained in its creation and interpretation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some capability to store, version, and transmit it</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unstructured artifacts such as plans, designs, and reports in particular impose high cognitive load. As digital organizations automate their pipelines, it becomes essential to identify the key events and elements they may represent, so that they can be embedded into the automation layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, even if a given process framework does not specifically call for waterfall, one can sometimes still see its legacy. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Calls for thorough project planning and estimation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cautions against "cutting corners"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Design specifications" moving through approval pipelines (and following a progression from general to detailed)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these tend to signal a large batch orientation, even in frameworks making some claim of supporting Agile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Good system design is a complex process. We introduced <a href="#technical-debt-1">technical debt</a> in Chapter 3, and will revisit it in technical-debt[Chapter 12]. But the slow <a href="#2.00.01-feedback">feedback</a> signals resulting from the batch processes implied by some frameworks are unacceptable in current industry.

<h6 id="_confusion_of_process_definition">Confusion of process definition</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One final issue with the "process" frameworks is that, while they use the word "process" prominently, they are not aligned with Business Process Management best practices. <a href="#Betz2011b">[Betz2011b]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these frameworks provide useful descriptions of major ongoing capabilities and functions that the large IT organization must perform. But in terms of our preceding discussion on process method, they in general are developed from the perspective of steady-state functions, as opposed to a value stream or defined process perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be seen by looking above at ITIL, for example. A Business Process Management consultant would see the term "Capacity Management" and observe that it is not countable or event-driven. "How many Capacities did you do today?," might be the question.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The BPM community is clear that processes and countable and event-driven (see <a href="#Sharp2009">[Sharp2009]</a>). Naming them with a strong active verb is seen as essential. "True" IT processes therefore might include:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Accept Demand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliver Release</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like project management, the practice of process management is under scrutiny in the new Lean and Agile-influenced digital world.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s little question the idea of statistical process control for product development has been superseded by Scrum and Lean Product Development. However, this is not only a textbook on product development. It covers all of traditional IT management, in its new guise of the digitally transformed organization. Agile, per se, is primarily about product (software) development, but one thing the frameworks make clear is that development is only part of digital management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearly, the concept of "process" is important and will persist through digital transformation. It seems we need a more robust set of tools to discuss it. Process control theory may offer some. At a more pragmatic level, this chapter will break the problem into a lifecycle of:</p>

<p>Such reactions are commonplace in social media, but we need a more objective and rational approach to understand the pros and cons of processes. Don Reinertsen uses a number of neutral concepts towards this end (<a href="#Reinertsen2009">[Reinertsen2009]</a>, chapters 3, 6 and 7):</p>

<p>Many of the issues with process comes from a failure to correctly understand and analyze the organization needs in objective terms such as these. This is the focus of <a href="#toyota-kata">Toyota Kata</a>. A process is a technique, a tool, and no technique should be implemented without a thorough understanding of the business context.

<p>A skeptical and self-critical, "go and see" approach is therefore essential.

<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
One organization enthusiastically embraced process improvement, with good reason: customers, suppliers, and employees found the company&#8217;s processes slow, inconsistent, and error prone. Unfortunately, they were so enthusiastic that each team defined the work of their small group or department as a complete process. Of course, each of these was in fact the contribution of a specialized functional group to some larger, but unidentified, processes. Each of these "processes" was "improved" independently, and you can guess what happened.<br>
<br>
Within the boundaries of each process, improvements were implemented that made work more efficient from the perspective of the performer. However, these mini-processes were efficient largely because they had front-end constraints that made work easier for the performer but imposed a burden on the customer or the preceding process. The attendant delay and effort meant that the true business processes behaved even more poorly than they had before. This is a common outcome when processes are defined too "small." Moral: Don&#8217;t confuse subprocesses or activities with business processes.

<p>The above quote well illustrates the dangers of combining local optimization and  process management. Many current authors speak highly of self-organizing teams, but self-organizing teams may seek to optimize locally. Process management was originally intended to overcome this problem, but modeling techniques can be applied at various levels, including within specific departments. This is where enterprise business architecture can assist, by identifying these longer, end to end flows of value and highlighting the handoff areas, so that the process benefits the larger objective.</p>

<p>Another pitfall we cover here is that of process proliferation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Process is a powerful tool. Ultimately it is how value is delivered. However, too many processes can have negative results on an organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Review the fundamentals of process modeling, and the discussion of the frameworks above. One thing that you do not see is any attention to the resource impacts of the process. This is a primary difference between project and process management; in process management (both theory and frameworks), resource availability is in general assumed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More advanced forms of process modeling and simulation (see " <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=discrete+event+simulation">discrete event simulation</a>)" can provide insight into the resource demands for processes. However, such techniques 1) require specialized tooling and 2) are not part of the typical BPM practitioner&#8217;s skillset.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many enterprise environments have multiple cross-functional processes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">

<p>compliance certifications,</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>and many more.</p>

<p>Such processes can be implemented on the assumption that enterprises can always accommodate another process. The result can be dramatic overburden for digital staff in complex environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is therefore advisable to at least keep an inventory of processes that may impose demand on staff, and understand both the aggregate demand as well as the degree of <a href="#multi-tasking">multi-tasking and context-switching</a> that may result (as discussed in Chapter 5).

<h6 id="_the_checklist_manifesto">The Checklist Manifesto</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Checklist Manifesto is the name of a notable book by author/surgeon Atul Gawande <a href="#Gawande2010">[Gawande2010]</a>. The title can be misleading; the book in no way suggests that all work can be reduced to repeatable checklists. Instead, it is another in depth examination of the  relationship between standardization and complexity. Like case management, it addresses the problem of complex activities requiring professional judgement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unlike case management, it explores more time-limited and often urgent activities such as flight operations, large scale construction, and surgery. These activities, as a whole, cannot be reduced to one master process; there is too much variation and complexity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, within the overall bounds of flight operations, or construction, or surgery, there are critical sequences of events that MUST be executed, often in a specific order. Gawande discusses the airline industry as a key exemplar of this. Instead of one "master checklist" there are specific, clear, brief checklists for a wide variety of scenarios, such as a cargo hold door becoming unlatched.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are similarities and differences between core BPM approaches and checklists. Often, business process management is employed to describe processes that are automated and whose progress is tracked in a database. Checklists, on the other hand, may be more manual, intended for use in a closely collaborative environment (such as a an aircraft cockpit or operating room), and may represent a briefer period of time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, in chapter 8, we discussed the concept of the <a href="#submittal-schedule">submittal schedule</a>, which Gawande encountered in his discussions with the construction industry. In this approach, the actual, trackable task is that <strong>two or more parties consult with each other.</strong> This technique is also applicable in a BPM and Case Management sense.</p>

<p>Since our initial discussions in Chapter 5 on Work Management, we have progressed through Project and Process Management, and find ourselves returning full circle. Despite the various ways in which work is conceived, funded, and formulated, at the end "it&#8217;s all just work." We must retain our concern for the "human resources" (that is, people) who find themselves at the mercy of:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>project fractional allocations driving multi-tasking</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>processes imposed top down with no demand analysis or evaluation of benefits</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Lean movement manages through minimizing waste and over-processing. This means both taking out un-necessary steps from processes, <strong>AND eliminating un-necessary processes completely when required</strong>. Correspondingly, the processes that remain should have high levels of visibility. They should be taken with the utmost seriousness, and their status should be central to most people&#8217;s awareness. (This is the purpose of <a href="#andon">Andon</a>.)</p>

<h6 id="_from_workflow_tools_to_collaboration_and_digital_exhaust">From workflow tools to collaboration and digital exhaust</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One reason process tends to generate friction and be unpopular is the poor usability of workflow tools. Older tools tend to present myriads of data fields to the user and expect a high degree of training. Each state change in the process is supposed to be logged and tracked by having someone sign in to the tool and update status manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By contrast, modern workflow approaches take full advantage of mobile platforms and integration with technology like chat rooms. Mobile development imposes higher standards for user experience (UX) design, which makes tracking workflow somewhat easier. Integrated software pipelines that integrate application lifecycle management and/or project management with source code and build management are increasingly gaining favor. For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A user logs a new feature request in the ALM tool</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the request is assigned to a developer, the tool automatically creates a feature branch in the source control system for the developer to work on</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The developer writes tests and associated code that merge changes back to the central repository once tests are passed successfully</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system automatically runs build tests</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The ALM tool is automatically updated accordingly with completion if all tests pass</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See also the previous discussion of <a href="#ChatOps">ChatOps</a>, which similarly combines communication and execution in a low-friction manner, while providing rich digital exhaust as an audit trail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general, the idea is that we can understand digital processes not through painful manual status updates, but rather through their digital exhaust - the data byproducts of people performing the value-add day to day work, at speed and with flow instead of constant delays for approvals and status updates.</p>

<h5 id="_the_idea_of_pmdb_and_pis">The idea of PMDB and PIs</h5>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Originally published at <a href="http://www.lean4it.com/2014/06/in-search-of-the-pcmdb-and-pcis.html" class="bare">http://www.lean4it.com/2014/06/in-search-of-the-pcmdb-and-pcis.html</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In search of the PMDB and PIs</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As I was preparing chicken piccata last night, I had one of those flashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the IT industry, why don&#8217;t we care about process information the same way we care about configuration information?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve had a 15-year conversation about CMDBs. It&#8217;s a well known idea that all configuration data should be put in a repository, or short of that, should be seen as part of an federated system. Applications, servers, databases, files, queues, executables, services, racks, switches, etc, etc, etc should all be seen as Configuration Items, or "CIs."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, if you ask ITSM advocates about processes, they will talk specifically about Incidents, Problems, Changes, Releases, etc as if they all are fundamentally different.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think we need the concept of a Process Item - just as a specific Server and an Application can both be CIs, so can a specific Incident and a Change both be PIs. They could inhabit the same PMDB, or be federated in a common PMS. [Yes, I recognize the unfortunate acronym :-) Let&#8217;s figure out better naming later.]</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This in fact is how many actual implementations of IT management tools work. But at a framework level, it is NOT how people are educated in IT management - the education and mental model continues to be that Incidents, Changes and Problems are very distinct and at best cross-reference each other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the world of Process, we have a series of related terms that indicate a</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>"potentially recurring series of events with various complexity (parallelism, sequentially related or not, and so on)"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>as the Oracle Communications Model states. Under this general heading we have:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Program</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Service Request</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incident</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Problem (and other Improvement Opportunity)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But (as I have pointed out elsewhere) the way these are currently implemented is too often as distinct queues of work with no coordination and understanding of aggregate demand. There is no awareness or concern when people who are critical to a Project also wind up handling high criticality Incidents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think there is much justification for promoting the ideas of Process Item and a unified PMDB as  industry guidance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, it aligns well with the growing interest in Kanban and limiting work in process. All these Process types compete for resources. If all are seen as fundamentally similar then it is possible to understand the aggregate demand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My coverage as an analyst of the Professional Services Automation tool sector (e.g. Tigerpaw) suggests that this class of tooling is already moving in this direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are complex dependencies between PIs just as with CIs - larger grained PIs such as Project may contain any number of smaller grained PI types such as Release, Change, and Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above-mentioned Oracle Communications Model (which is now conformant with eTOM) requires that the PROCESS entity be used as the overarching parent for all process activity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During one large program I was part of, all Releases, Project milesones, and Changes were consolidated into a single timeline view which was praised by senior executives as one of the best orienting mechanisms they had seen.
I have seen various attempts and interest along these lines, but always company or vendor specific. I wonder if the lack of a PI/PMDB concept in fact may be why the concept of CMDB has had such struggles.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>People have often said to me, "Isn&#8217;t the CMDB the basis of ERP for IT"?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My view is no, no more than the Bill of Materials is the basis for manufacturing ERP. The core of ERP systems is more about process and execution, and that is what we are missing in large scale IT management. We&#8217;ve spent years struggling with the data-centric orientation the CMDB discussion gave us, while shortchanging the process and execution side of the work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I realize the red flags that come up with any suggestion of a centralized system, which is why I am more in favor of seeing the PI concept as a logical interface. If all Process Items had some degree of overarching consistency, they could be exchanged and federated as part of execution activities, without requiring a monolithic centralized data store.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In conclusion, we have considered:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Why process management matters, and is not likely to go away</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The basics of process description and modeling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some background and history of continuous improvement and process control</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The major IT-related process frameworks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emerging approaches for digital process management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you stand on the threshold of scaling your company yet again, to the enterprise level, you will find process management an essential tool. Like any powerful tool, it has its dangers if misused. Be wary of claims of statistical process control in creative activities, and avoid burdensome process tracking and compliance approaches. Challenge all proposed processes, keep them lean, but if they "make the cut," then make sure everyone knows their existence and status.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s been an interesting ride, scaling up from a team to a team of teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve considered our organizational structure and our culture, and the importance of culture in organizational effectiveness.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve also considered the fundamentals of project and resource management, with some caution and with an understanding that not all work is performed through classical project management and its iron triangle of cost, quality, and scope.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, process management is a critical practice in business operations, and will continue into the digital era. There are a variety of approaches, concerns and techniques that must be considered and correctly applied.</p>
