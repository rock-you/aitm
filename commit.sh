# yes this is really tightly coupled to my workstations.

# I am using my "adoc" toolchain (stolen from Pro Git) as a basis.

# two peer repos @ same level, one "aitm" and one "aitm-pages"
# making this collaborative will need some help.

git add . -A && git commit -m "commit"
git push origin master

mv aitm-student.html index.html  # hack, I should figure out the CLI parm for the rake command

# copy html & images to github pages
# dependent on successfully changing directories along relative paths. heaven help the person who runs this other than from the aitm dir, with aitm-pages at the same level.

cp -R images ../aitm-pages/
cp *.html ../aitm-pages/

cd ../aitm-pages   # ugly & brittle.
git pull # pull down previous html. never gets edited by hand.
