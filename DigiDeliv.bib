abstract = {Dependencies in a software project can contribute to
unsatisfactory progress if they constrain or block
the flow of work. Various studies highlight the
importance of dependencies in the organisation of
work; however dependencies in agile software
development projects have not previously been a
research focus. Drawing on three case studies of
agile software projects, and the IS literature, this
paper develops an initial taxonomy of agile software
project dependencies. Three distinct categories of
dependency are found: task, resource, and knowledge
dependencies. This paper contributes to theory by
providing a taxonomy of dependency types occurring in
the area of agile software development. Practitioners
can use this taxonomy as sensitising device to ensure
they consider dependencies they might face that could
hinder their projects, enabling them to take
appropriate and timely mitigating action.},

@article{Strode2012a,
abstract = {Agile software development provides a way to organise
the complex task of multi-participant soft-ware
development while accommodating constant project
change. Agile software development is well accepted
in the practitioner community but there is little
understanding of how such projects achieve effective
coordination, which is known to be critical in
successful software projects. A theoretical model of
coordination in the agile software development
context is presented based on empirical data from
three cases of co-located agile software development.
Many practices in these projects act as coordina-tion
mechanisms, which together form a coordination
strategy. Coordination strategy in this context has
three components: synchronisation, structure, and
boundary spanning. Coordination effectiveness has two
components: implicit and explicit. The theoretical
model of coordination in agile software devel-opment
projects proposes that an agile coordination strategy
increases coordination effectiveness. This model has
application for practitioners who want to select
appropriate practices from agile methods to ensure
they achieve coordination coverage in their project.
For the field of information systems develop-ment,
this theory contributes to knowledge of coordination
and coordination effectiveness in the context of
agile software development.},

@article{Carr2003,
abstract = {Description: As information technology has grown in power and ubiquity, companies have come to view it as evermore critical to their success; their heavy spending on hardware and software clearly reflects that assumption. Chief executives routinely talk about information technology's strategic value, about how they can use IT to gain a competitive edge. But scarcity, not ubiquity, makes a business resource truly strategic--and allows companies to use it for a sustained competitive advantage. You gain an edge over rivals only by doing something that they can't. IT is the latest in a series of broadly adopted technologies--think of the railroad or the electric generator--that have reshaped industry over the past two centuries. For a brief time, these technologies created powerful opportunities for forward-looking companies. But as their availability increased and their costs decreased, they became commodity inputs. From a strategic standpoint, they no longer mattered. That's exactly what's happening to IT, and the implications are profound. In this article, HBR's Editor-at-Large Nicholas Carr suggests that IT management should, frankly, become boring. It should focus on reducing risks, not increasing opportunities. For example, companies need to pay more attention to ensuring network and data security. Even more important, they need to manage IT costs more aggressively. IT may not help you gain a strategic advantage, but it could easily put you at a cost disadvantage.},

abstract = {Software developers are rooted in the written form of their code, yet they often draw diagrams representing their code. Unfortunately, we still know little about how and why they create these diagrams, and so there is little research to inform the design of visual tools to support developers' work. This paper presents findings from semi-structured interviews that have been validated with a structured survey. Results show that most of the diagrams had a transient nature because of the high cost of changing whiteboard sketches to electronic renderings. Diagrams that documented design decisions were often externalized in these temporary drawings and then subsequently lost. Current visualization tools and the software development practices that we observed do not solve these issues, but these results suggest several directions for future research.},

He describes a broad range of agile product management practices, including making agile product discovery work, taking advantage of emergent requirements, creating the minimal marketable product, leveraging early customer feedback, and working closely with the development team. Benefitting from Pichler's extensive experience, you'll learn how Scrum product ownership differs from traditional product management and how to avoid and overcome the common challenges that Scrum product owners face. Coverage includes Understanding the product owner's role: what product owners do, how they do it, and the surprising implications Envisioning the product: creating a compelling product vision to galvanize and guide the team and stakeholders Grooming the product backlog: managing the product backlog effectively even for the most complex products Planning the release: bringing clarity to scheduling, budgeting, and functionality decisions Collaborating in sprint meetings: understanding the product owner's role in sprint meetings, including the dos and don'ts Transitioning into product ownership: succeeding as a product owner and establishing the role in the enterprise This book is an indispensable resource for anyone who works as a product owner, or expects to do so, as well as executives and coaches interested in establishing agile product management.},

Startups don't fail because of bad execution, or missed deadlines, or blown budgets. They fail because they are building something nobody wants. Whether they arise from someone's garage or are created within a mature Fortune 500 organization, new ventures, by definition, are designed to create new products or services under conditions of extreme uncertainly. Their primary mission is to find out what customers ultimately will buy. One of the central premises of The Lean Startup movement is what Ries calls "validated learning" about the customer. It is a way of getting continuous feedback from customers so that the company can shift directions or alter its plans inch by inch, minute by minute. Rather than creating an elaborate business plan and a product-centric approach, Lean Startup prizes testing your vision continuously with your customers and making constant adjustments"--},

@article{Kurtz2003,
abstract = {In this paper, we challenge the universality of three basic assumptions prevalent in organizational decision support and strategy: assumptions of order, of rational choice, and of intent. We describe the Cynefin framework, a sense-making device we have developed to help people make sense of the complexities made visible by the relaxation of these assumptions. The Cynefin framework is derived from several years of action research into the use of narrative and complexity theory in organizational knowledge exchange, decision-making, strategy, and policy-making. The framework is explained, its conceptual underpinnings are outlined, and its use in group sense-making and discourse is described. Finally, the consequences of relaxing the three basic assumptions, using the Cynefin framework as a mechanism, are considered.},

@article{Malone1994,
abstract = {This survey characterizes an emerging research area,
sometimes called coordination theory, that focuses on
the interdisciplinary study of coordination. Research
in this area uses and extends ideas about
coordination from disciplines such as computer
science, organization theory, operations research,
economics, linguistics, and psychology. A key insight
of the framework presented here is that coordination
can be seen as the process of managing dependencies
among activities. Further progress, therefore, should
be possible by characterizing different kinds of
dependencies and identifying the coordination
processes that can be used to manage them. A variety
of processes are analyzed from this perspective, and
commonalities across disciplines are identified.
Processes analyzed include those for managing shared
resources, producer/consumer relationships,
simultaneity constraints, and tank/subtask
dependencies. Section 3 summarizes ways of applying a
coordination perspective in three different domains:
(1) understanding the effects of information
technology on human organizations and markets, (2)
designing cooperative work tools, and (3) designing
distributed and parallel computer systems. In the
final section, elements of a research agenda in this
new area are briefly outlined.},

Not just is much design activity ridiculed as "Big Up Front Design", but such design techniques as the UML, flexible frameworks, and even patterns are de-emphasized or downright ignored. In fact XP involves a lot of design, but does it in a different way than established software processes. XP has rejuvenated the notion of evolutionary design with practices that allow evolution to become a viable design strategy. It also provides new challenges and skills as designers need to learn how to do a simple design, how to use refactoring to keep a design clean, and how to use patterns in an evolutionary style.

The business model is like a blueprint for a strategy to be implemented through organizational structures, processes, and systems.},
