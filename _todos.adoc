Review https://github.com/FocusedObjective/FocusedObjective.Resources/tree/master/Canvas%20and%20Forms

compare every intro and every section intro for consistency of tone & voice

comprehensive use of "digital professional" instead of "IT"

Align introduction chapter summaries with sectional chapter summaries.

Find framework to transform to website.

Make sure person voice ("we" vs "you" is consistent)

Create contributor's view

Principles:

* Use that iterative product diagram - we want every chapter to represent a working core - or at least every section - eg section 1 does need all 3 -

Books in Further Reading sections are linked to Goodreads.

Check that all chapters flow as noted

. Business
. Process
. System

BASE THE BOOK ON USER STORIES - at least 2-3 each chapter...

"A day in the life" for every major role/concern

Should every chapter (@ least 1-6) have an enterprise as well as startup reading?

Second or third person in chapter/section setups?

more with antipatterns in each chapter?

The idea that we present any "on their own terms" needs to be tempered at the start of each section with the antipatterns so that Agile reader knows we "get it"

include standards in every chapter?

Every chapter should have a glossary.

What top 3 books influenced each chapter's point of view?

examine competing texts for the level they go on topic of mission/vision/principle/policy in particular

for every chapter, what does it mean that we have formalized it? How did the concern manifest when tacit?

testable LO-related keywords always italic?

consistent quote approach esp Wikipedia.

Be sure that all quotes have clear learning objectives & are discussed & contextualized

All new terminology well defined & linked

data: ops
insight: we need to scale

Part III: Team of Teams
Special section: Scaling the organization and its work

+context from Cantor - environment...

a central principle for the agile manager: Focus on the work, not the process. This principle is fraught with implications. It entails thinking of your business process, not as a defined set of activities but as a value stream, a set of actions that transform the states of work items so that they accrue value. The accrual of value, no matter what the process, is central to agile thinking. This is sometimes described as an ‘artifact-centric’ business process. This means to stop worrying about key process areas and measuring process adherence. The agile team goal should not be to adhere to a defined process, but to efficiently deliver value under changing circumstances.

Irregular flow
New information  (brilliant)

Risk curve - appropriate to 2nd half - now we look back at where we've been... it was a new system but now it is maturing - we have more options for how to manage the work - but the work is now more variable.

novelty continuum (cantor part 1) - we started w/MVP, saw it mature to sCrum
now we need to remember that mvp != steady kanban flow

consistency of artifact...

the order in which software
components can be built is much more fluid than that in which the elements of civil
projects can be constructed. Using encapsulation and simulation, the order of execution
is not fixed – there is more than one critical path. (cantor part 1)

Time frames
The delivery models
+ systems thinking revisited

a worker “owns” a set of state transitions for one or more artifacts (cantor 2) - back to definition of done

Narrative from scratch:

The first six chapters have presented a number of topics we now must rationalize
Essentially we started off on  journey of discovery that, through luck and skill, succeeded
The system we built is stabilizing. We are scaling. We need to take a look back.

We have considered creative product discovery, practical work management, and mission critical operations management. These activities are consistent with a well known continuum of variability and risk that is seen throughout industrial engineering and operations research.

illustration: risk curve / cantor/ reversed showing chapters 4-6 - S curve going up

now we consider coordination and control in order of time frame feedback loop

* immediate execution challenges
* mid-term planning and investment
* long term organization structure and culture

we have to consider dimensions:

* predictability
** variation in demand - arrival rates & granularity
** feedback loops 
* planning time frame
* granularity of work concept

back to planning vs granularity
