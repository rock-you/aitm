Todos

replace all "corporation" with "organization"

comprehensive use of "digital professional" instead of "IT"

Align introduction chapter summaries with sectional chapter summaries.

Find framework to transform to website.

Make sure person voice ("we" vs "you" is consistent)

Create contributor's view

Principles:

* Use that iterative product diagram - we want every chapter to represent a working core - or at least every section - eg section 1 does need all 3 -

Books in Further Reading sections are linked to Goodreads.

Check that all chapters flow as noted

. Business
. Process
. System

BASE THE BOOK ON USER STORIES - at least 2-3 each chapter...

"A day in the life" for every major role/concern

Should every chapter (@ least 1-6) have an enterprise as well as startup reading?

Second or third person in chapter/section setups?

more with antipatterns in each chapter?

The idea that we present 8-12 "on their own terms" needs to be tempered at the start of each section with the antipatterns so that Agile reader knows we "get it"

include standards in every chapter?

Every chapter should have a glossary.

What top 3 books influenced each chapter's point of view?

examine competing texts for the level they go on topic of mission/vision/principle/policy in particular

for every chapter, what does it mean that we have formalized it? How did the concern manifest when tacit?

testable LO-related keywords always italic?

consistent quote approach esp Wikipedia.

Be sure that all quotes have clear learning objectives & are discussed & contextualized

All new terminology well defined & linked
