Review https://github.com/FocusedObjective/FocusedObjective.Resources/tree/master/Canvas%20and%20Forms

compare every intro and every section intro for consistency of tone & voice

replace all "corporation" with "organization"

comprehensive use of "digital professional" instead of "IT"

Align introduction chapter summaries with sectional chapter summaries.

Find framework to transform to website.

Make sure person voice ("we" vs "you" is consistent)

Create contributor's view

Principles:

* Use that iterative product diagram - we want every chapter to represent a working core - or at least every section - eg section 1 does need all 3 -

Books in Further Reading sections are linked to Goodreads.

Check that all chapters flow as noted

. Business
. Process
. System

BASE THE BOOK ON USER STORIES - at least 2-3 each chapter...

"A day in the life" for every major role/concern

Should every chapter (@ least 1-6) have an enterprise as well as startup reading?

Second or third person in chapter/section setups?

more with antipatterns in each chapter?

The idea that we present 8-12 "on their own terms" needs to be tempered at the start of each section with the antipatterns so that Agile reader knows we "get it"

include standards in every chapter?

Every chapter should have a glossary.

What top 3 books influenced each chapter's point of view?

examine competing texts for the level they go on topic of mission/vision/principle/policy in particular

for every chapter, what does it mean that we have formalized it? How did the concern manifest when tacit?

testable LO-related keywords always italic?

consistent quote approach esp Wikipedia.

Be sure that all quotes have clear learning objectives & are discussed & contextualized

All new terminology well defined & linked

* ch6 product architecture leads to scenario: y-axis split

data: ops
insight: we need to scale

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

8 investment ... now we need 2 teams -
1 The portfolio
*** starts w/the customer (CRM here?)
*** features are discovered
*** components are informed by AKF (and are relatively more constrained cogs)
*** both are investments
how function *becomes* product - my little data standards self-service example...

features - experiments run by one team
products - experiments requiring a whole new team
market facing products vs instrumental products

2 projects
3 sourcing
4 budgeting/planning

*** human fairness as key driver (foreshadows culture chapter)
*** money & time - how to estimate?
*** approach (the product/project boundary)

5 topics

9 execution

what is the relationship of the discovery process to the investment process to org

data, insight, belief, bet - as a loop
strengthened hypothesis leads to establishing org
even when you can easily form teams - this is a big deal
represents what might become a long term high value investment
NOT a VM to be torn down and spun up repeatedly


Process management, like project management, is a discipline unto itself and one of the most powerful tools in your toolbox. You start to realize there is a process by which  process itself is managed - the process of continuous improvement.  You remain concerned that work continues to flow well, that you don't take on too much work in process, and that people are not overloaded and multi-tasking.

Defining execution: PBR lite?

1 the problem of variability
*** the production spectrum
*** empirical vs defined process
*** project vs process
2 Coordination
*** Trad PM
*** clinical terminology (Reinertsen)
*** protecting team (pigs & chickens)
*** release train??
*** Flow & variability
*** RACI
*** risk
3 Financial control
** internal market econ
** the cost accounting problem
4 The frameworks
*** The broken ITOM
5 topics
shared resources and services
global CoD - process eval
the troubled history - PMBOK etc
